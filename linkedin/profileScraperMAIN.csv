https://www.linkedin.com/in/chai-xiang-hui/,,"Since young, my parents have imprinted in me the importance of being financially capable to support my future children for at least 25 years, such that they will not worry about finances up until they are ready to enter the workforce. However, throughout my student life previously, I was made aware of the economic uncertainties of my future, which has since prompted me to think about how life would be for my future children as well.

I am blessed to have met mentors in life at the right time who have helped open up my horizons to strive to secure my future children’s financial futures at will, with the freedom of time to nurture them throughout their childhoods with all my heart.

I genuinely believe that all of us out there have big dreams that we want to fulfil, great lives that we want to live, but we inevitably become the product of our circumstances as we choose to succumb to various pressures from our environments. However, it is the small, conscious decisions that we make everyday that take us closer to how we want to best live our lives.

I am eager to learn more on how data can be used to make business decisions and improve business processes. I am intrigued by how the analysis of data using statistical models, can interpret the future trends and possibly help to identify minor improvements to enhance a business process. I believe with the rapid technological advances, it is essential for companies to adopt these technologies to stay relevant in a world where analytics can transform industries.

I am exploring and picking up data analytics skills and certificates through courses during my free time and striving to be a data analyst in the future. Being inquisitive by nature, I also love to explore and pick up new skills. I strongly believe in the importance of having grit and resilience to not only survive but thrive in this world.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-halliday/,,"In his two decades in the business world, Luke has guided and assisted hundreds of businesses and leaders to improve business performance by aligning people, technology and process to create better outcomes. 

He does this using a ground-up approach, and by identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies then implementing actionable plans. Specialising in helping technical experts to become great leaders by letting go of 'doing' and empowering their people to thrive. 
 
Luke believes that every success story is built on outcomes from a solid foundation of customer understanding, proven business strategies, and highly disciplined attention to detail. His mission is to enable organisations to unlock their true potential through great people and technology. He uses his years of experience as an entrepreneur, consultant and executive to help them do so in the shortest time possible.  
 
In 2004, Luke co-founded Mercury IT, a business that has been in continuous operation since and won several awards along the way. Early in his career, Luke realised that the recipe for success had multiple ingredients. Being ‘good at what you do’ is just one of them. He decided to invest every second of his free time to broaden his horizons, develop new skills, and learn more about finance, marketing strategies, sales techniques, and customer behaviour. 
 
Luke transitioned from executive to non-executive director of Mercury in 2017 to complete his Master of Business Administration. While completing his MBA, he was appointed Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Australia Pacific Airport Corporation (incorporating Melbourne and Launceston airports), the second-largest airport operator in Australia. He led the transformation of the corporation’s IT business into a value-aligned strategic partner within the business, by developing cost optimisations, improving customer service, and reducing IT risks.

My expected graduation would be in May 2022.

Having a great passion in software development and game development, I have been motivating myself to develop my knowledge and skills in these fields as well as keeping up with the trends of these fields through self-learning. Furthermore, I believe that my passion is more than seeking new knowledge and skills in software development and game development because it is more important to have the opportunity to apply my analytical abilities to solve real-world problems and assist in real-world projects. As I would like to apply my knowledge of software development and analytical skills to solve real-world problems, I am currently working with a tech team in developing and maintaining a sustainable book-selling app, SwapSwipe.

Furthermore, I have also developed my analytical skills as I volunteered to take on the responsibility in carrying out data analysis for my Statistics module's group project. Also, I have experience in organising events as I have participated in an environmental project which has given me the opportunity to plan and manage an event, Green Lab, which comprised of a talk by Zero Waste SG and a eco-cleaner workshop. The process of planning this event has also trained me to build strong communication skills as I was tasked to liaise and communicate with external party and discuss my ideas with my teammates who were involved in the project with me.

I am currently pursuing a computer science degree from Singapore Management University, but I also enjoy learning outside of class and keeping up with the industry. I am especially interested in software architecture and design patterns, and I always strive to write beautiful code.

I am comfortable in C, and have a strong inclination towards computer systems and hardware, and its impacts on cybersecurity. In addition, I enjoy developing web applications and building backend systems.

I believe in always working on and being kind to myself, and I want to have a positive influence on others.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-tan-85ab3664/,bengthye.tan@gmail.com,"I thrive under stress. I love to overcome challenges with unique innovations. My cup of tea is to plan and execute a blue ocean strategy, often with the use of computational or engineering innovations.

I have been an enigma all my life…

- The inaugural nuclear scholar from Singapore, whose limited land area inhibits reactor siting.
- The scientist who rode a motorcycle in winter from Cambridge to London.
- The graduate student who drove across the British Channelfrom Right Hand Drive UK to Left Hand Drive France in a 20 year old Citroen. 
- The geek who dances semi-professionally and plays in a band.
- The physics graduate who learnt about crystals, uranium chemistry, nuclear energy, high performance computing, artificial intelligence and this is probably the beginning!
- The C-Suite who puts his team above himself. 
 
And I still have a long way to go. 

I have taught and spoken at top academic institutions like NUS, Singapore Science Centre, Goldschmidt- Paris, Cambridge University, Oxford University and Australian- ANSTO on a wide variety of topics ranging from nuclear physics to computer engineering. I am also an associate at many organisations such as Fellow of Geological Society, London, The Oxford and Cambridge Society of Singapore, Society of Medical Physicists (Singapore).

As Chief Scientist of Carro, I lead all aspects of technological innovations in 4 countries in Southeast Asia – Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. This includes the wide use of data analytics/ statistics, data science, algorithms, machine learning in the domain of data visualisation computer vision, acoustic analysis, behavioural analytics, engineering and IOT innovation. These are mainly based on Python, C/C++ and Java. 

Here at Carro, we leverage technology to debut several “Singapore’s first” technological innovations like: 

- First Usage-based insurance by using Telematics
- First Contactless Car viewing. 
- First Computer Vision model to analyse defects in cars
and many more (patent pending). 

We are recruiting a team of young, enthusiastic data scientists and engineers to join us in this endeavour to make Carro the #1 AI-Driven Used Car Marketplace in Asia.","Chief Scientist of South East Asia’s First Unicorn Car Marketplace CARRO 🦄  | A.I, Tech Innovations Strategist | Tech Thought Leader | Lecturer | Nuclear Scientist | Environmental Social Governance Activist",Singapore,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHcuVhxHQb7wg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1632836844539?e=1653523200&v=beta&t=vlCMvqUyffZfrGzJHa0JDKBgZRVivxe6rd75lklka_E,Bryan,Tan,Bryan Tan,269,1st,ACoAAA2xpEYBX9eoXyV9hoaE8ZJnkA0BlxHTBj0,229745734,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAA2xpEYBX9eoXyV9hoaE8ZJnkA0BlxHTBj0,name",266,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAA2xpEYBX9eoXyV9hoaE8ZJnkA0BlxHTBj0%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAA2xpEYBX9eoXyV9hoaE8ZJnkA0BlxHTBj0%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,https://www.linkedin.com/company/4522/,,,,"Mathematical Physics, Nuclear Physics, Statistical Data Analysis, Data Science, Product Innovation, Customer Insight, Engineering, Research, Strategy, Machine Learning, Quantitative Research, Segmentation, Data Visualization, Predictive Analytics",Mathematical Physics,,Nuclear Physics,,Statistical Data Analysis,,Data Science,,Product Innovation,,Customer Insight,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-tan-85ab3664/,bryan-tan-85ab3664,2022-03-24T07:55:46.854Z,,Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative,Research Fellow,,"Doctor of Philosophy - PhD, Earth Science (Machine Learning and Computational Physics)",,,,,,,,,,,,

Concurrently, I am pursuing a Degree in Commerce (Management) at the University of Western Australia. Throughout the course, I have covered areas such as Marketing Research, Human Resource Management, Supply Chain Management and Project Management.

Previously, having completed Diploma in Business Studies in Temasek Polytechnic, I found my interest in developing my knowledge and skills in the management aspect of Business. Additionally, during my time at Temasek Polytechnic, I had interned at DHL E-Commerce and had the opportunity to develop an SOP for their operations.

Additionally, during the school breaks, I participated in a variety of school related challenges. This saw me working in teams to develop different solutions to solve existing issues. This provided me with the opportunity to develop skills such as collaboration, problem solving, design thinking and time management.

Furthermore, I had started my own clothing brand called Five Liars (www.fiveliars.com) in July of 2020. This is a personal project, which I started because of my passion for designing clothing and an interest in starting my own business. As I had to start the business from the ground up, it has actually helped me with certain units in my university degree due to the relevance of certain concepts that would be practiced in the business.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/hueisuentan/,tanhueisuen@gmail.com,"👋Hey, it's Huei Suen. I am a UI/UX designer with an interest in photography, book podcasting and doing my part to reduce my environmental impact ! 

💼It all began in 2019 when I discovered I had a passion for solving problems with better design. Since then, I’ve embarked on a breadth of projects concerning e-commerce, HR technology, web accessibility, and green business. My main experience lies in working in startups. I worked remotely as the sole UI/UX designer during the COVID-19 lockdown and managed cross-border colleagues to deliver features. The fast-paced culture, cross-functional teams and autonomy is where I thrive and grow. I come from a multi-disciplinary background with a major in tech and marketing which easily allows me to communicate and work well in cross-functional teams.

📚I love reading for leisure and for self-improvement so much that I decided to start a book review podcast called 'What's On My Shelf' to inspire interest in books and people to read. Do give it a listen!

🌎For as long as I can recall, I have always been close to nature. Photography has also helped me appreciate nature more than ever. I want to do more to be a part of the climate solution because it is definitely a pressing problem for humanity. For now, I donate, practise my 3Rs - reduce, reuse, recycle, and try to spread awareness on social media.

I am an undergraduate at Singapore Management University, School of Social Sciences with a first major in Psychology and second major in Marketing. I will be graduating in May 2022. If I had to describe myself in three words it would be: convivial, creative and compassionate.

My first encounter with a psychology-related module in polytechnic piqued my interests in the mysteries and wonders of our human brain. My decision to pursue a Psychology degree after obtaining my diploma in Mass Communication is a step towards deepening my knowledge and expanding my skillsets. 

The commonalities people share definitely make the world more connected, and the differences are what sets us apart from one another, in a good and value-adding perspective. 

My goal is to become a Marketer as I believe that it is the sweet spot between my diploma and degree. I know I have the hard and soft skills to produce quality work and make meaningful connections wherever I go. 

I look forward to connecting and working with you in the near future.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/kitsiangk-853/,kit_siang.2018@outlook.com,"I am a final year student, currently studying Bachelor of Science (BSc) Information Systems with a major in Smart-City Management & Technology in Singapore Management University (SMU). My expected graduation would be in May 2022.

Having a great passion in software development and game development, I have been motivating myself to develop my knowledge and skills in these fields as well as keeping up with the trends of these fields through self-learning. Furthermore, I believe that my passion is more than seeking new knowledge and skills in software development and game development because it is more important to have the opportunity to apply my analytical abilities to solve real-world problems and assist in real-world projects. As I would like to apply my knowledge of software development and analytical skills to solve real-world problems, I am currently working with a tech team in developing and maintaining a sustainable book-selling app, SwapSwipe.

Furthermore, I have also developed my analytical skills as I volunteered to take on the responsibility in carrying out data analysis for my Statistics module's group project. Also, I have experience in organising events as I have participated in an environmental project which has given me the opportunity to plan and manage an event, Green Lab, which comprised of a talk by Zero Waste SG and a eco-cleaner workshop. The process of planning this event has also trained me to build strong communication skills as I was tasked to liaise and communicate with external party and discuss my ideas with my teammates who were involved in the project with me.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-ng-10/,richardyer@gmail.com,"I am a second year Computer Science student at the Singapore Management University, with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence.  Having read Computation Thinking in SMU while in my final year of high school, I was inspired by the strong potential for technology to reframe one's thinking and improve people's lives. As a believer that learning takes place both in and out of the classroom, I balance academic excellence with a range of endeavours outside of class to sharpen my technical skills.

My focus the past academic year has been on gaining experience in Artificial Intelligence. Through the SMUBIA's Data Associates Programme, I embarked on a project to digitise hand-drawn graphs using computer vision and deep learning. Over the summer, my research internship at Preferred.AI explored ways to augment NLP models to enhance the distributed representations of PowerPoint slides to develop a robust recommender system.

Motivated by a growth mindset, I am always looking for opportunities to make the most out of my days and gain exposure to different fields. Most recently, I participated in a hackathon where my team and I developed a personal finance application that accompanies one throughout their financial journey with long-term, tailored solutions powered by deep learning. Looking ahead for the academic year, my main focus will be to up-skill namely in the fields of machine learning, cloud architecture and core algorithms.

As an individual, I value authenticity and living a balanced lifestyle greatly. While I am not working, I enjoy exercising and spending time around nature on runs and walks.
