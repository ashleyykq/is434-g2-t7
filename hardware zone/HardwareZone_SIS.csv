0,SMU's rebranded IT school will have greater focus on computing and coding,tripleg,"Jan 15, 2021", ,"The renamed School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS) at Singapore Management University (SMU) will now have a greater focus on computer science, intensive programming and technology development.. Formerly known as the School Of Information Systems, SCIS will also almost double its annual enrolment of undergraduates from 276 to 520 this year.. This comes as SCIS launches more programmes that tap on team based learning, which the school believes is essential for jobs in today's information technology (IT) industry.. SMU’s education is known for its interactive, collaborative and project based approach to learning.. The new name was announced on Friday (Jan 15) at SCIS and reflects the expanded aspirations and role of the school beyond information systems to include computing, said SMU.. During the unveiling ceremony, SMU's president, Professor Lily Kong, said: ""The school has been refreshing and augmenting our undergraduate and postgraduate education programmes to go beyond information systems, particularly in the science of computing, hard core programming and technology development."". Professor Pang Hwee Hwa, dean of SCIS, said the rebranded school will focus on digital transformation, which focuses on preparing students to be valuable to businesses and organisations looking to use technology to stay competitive.. Digital transformation is one of three areas of focus identified by SMU to prepare its students to be multi disciplinary in the workforce. The other two areas of focus are on sustainable living and growth in Asia.. The school will continue to launch programmes to give its students more skills depth in computing and width in business and social science disciplines.. In August this year, the school will launch a second major in digital business which covers computing skills and the application of technologies to various business functions, and a digital transformation track for postgraduates interested in pursuing the Master of IT in Business programme.. Ms Pearlyn Thiam Zi Hui, a student in her second year at SCIS, said: ""I am pretty excited because it is a whole new direction for the school. The addition of computing will give us leverage in Singapore, especially since society is focusing a lot more on technology."". The 21 year old added that the new emphasis on computing will likely attract more prospective students to enrol in the future, given the demand for those who can code.. https://www.straitstimes.com/singap...ll have greater focus on computing and coding","the renamed school of computing and information systems (scis) at singapore management university (smu) will now have a greater focus on computer science intensive programming and technology development formerly known as the school of information systems scis will also almost double its annual enrolment of undergraduates from 276 to 520 this year this comes as scis launches more programmes that tap on team based learning which the school believes is essential for jobs in today's information technology (it) industry smu’s education is known for its interactive collaborative and project based approach to learning the new name was announced on friday (jan 15) at scis and reflects the expanded aspirations and role of the school beyond information systems to include computing said smu during the unveiling ceremony smu's president professor lily kong said: ""the school has been refreshing and augmenting our undergraduate and postgraduate education programmes to go beyond information systems particularly in the science of computing hard core programming and technology development"" professor pang hwee hwa dean of scis said the rebranded school will focus on digital transformation which focuses on preparing students to be valuable to businesses and organisations looking to use technology to stay competitive digital transformation is one of three areas of focus identified by smu to prepare its students to be multi disciplinary in the workforce the other two areas of focus are on sustainable living and growth in asia the school will continue to launch programmes to give its students more skills depth in computing and width in business and social science disciplines in august this year the school will launch a second major in digital business which covers computing skills and the application of technologies to various business functions and a digital transformation track for postgraduates interested in pursuing the master of it in business programme ms pearlyn thiam zi hui a student in her second year at scis said: ""i am pretty excited because it is a whole new direction for the school the addition of computing will give us leverage in singapore especially since society is focusing a lot more on technology"" the 21 year old added that the new emphasis on computing will likely attract more prospective students to enrol in the future given the demand for those who can code https://wwwstraitstimescom/singapll have greater focus on computing and coding"

If you dont have background, dont worry, but you have to try very hard.
During first year, fundamental java module , around 15  20 or more students will fail. People who have gotten 49.xx marks also considered fail
Then have to wait one more year as that module is provided once every year. You will be one year slower than your peers (you will have to take with the 2014 batch student next year) because if you fail the fundamental java, you cant take Object oriented which is the part two of java. Then moving on to Object Oriented Module, again, around 15 20 ppl will fail.. During my time, if your lab test cannot compile, meaning got syntax error, 50% of your marks will be gone. Lab test constitute around 30% of your overall module score. So people will be getting like 3/30, for those who did well, they will get full marks.","had just graduated from is

57,SMU IS or SMU BIZ,ohgnod,"May 29, 2015", ,"Hi guys, so I’m in a dilemma… I was offered NUS Sci and NTU Biosci. I’m good in science but honestly, I don’t have the passion for it and I don’t see myself working in a lab/taking masters or phd in the future.. So I went to reinstate my application for SMU SIS, I was then accepted 4 hours after I went for the interview. The interview went really well, definitely one of the easiest and laidback interviews I’ve been to, despite all the horror stories. I can SO TOTALLY see myself doing biz + tech in the future. But, I don’t have much programming knowledge (coded in html when I was in pri sch, during the era when having a blog was cool but that was sooooo long ago haha) and from my research, IS is one of the toughest course in SMU with the average GPA of 2.8/2.9. The number of cum laude students in IS is significantly smaller as compared to the other schools in SMU. I’m afraid that if I were to enroll into IS I will do very badly. I've accepted SMU's offer (as of now) because i would rather do IS than natural sciences.. I like biz and tech, but it doesn’t mean that I will be good at it.

Hi guys, so I’m in a dilemma… I was offered NUS Sci and NTU Biosci. I’m good in science but honestly, I don’t have the passion for it and I don’t see myself working in a lab/taking masters or phd in the future.. So I went to reinstate my application for SMU SIS, I was then accepted 4 hours after I went for the interview. The interview went really well, definitely one of the easiest and laidback interviews I’ve been to, despite all the horror stories. I can SO TOTALLY see myself doing biz + tech in the future. But, I don’t have much programming knowledge (coded in html when I was in pri sch, during the era when having a blog was cool but that was sooooo long ago haha) and from my research, IS is one of the toughest course in SMU with the average GPA of 2.8/2.9. The number of cum laude students in IS is significantly smaller as compared to the other schools in SMU. I’m afraid that if I were to enroll into IS I will do very badly. I've accepted SMU's offer (as of now) because i would rather do IS than natural sciences.. I like biz and tech, but it doesn’t mean that I will be good at it. On the other hand, I don’t have the fiery passion for science but I’m good in it..

My response to you is: Go with your passion.. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.. Also, with regards to your question on SIS and low GPA, I can tell you the unique selling point about SMU's SIS and why their students from that school receive e higher starting pay than that of their Business School is because of their numerous portfolio's and job experiences the SIS's students have.. 
You might have a GPA of 4.0 when you graduate, but if you think about this, Information systems require a strong technical knowledge and competencies/know how to complete your job. Having experience would be a +1 factor imo.. At the end of the day, the person who hires someone in Information Systems wouldn't care about high GPA. Sure. You get High GPA from passing tests in school, but what about real live projects? Real life clients? They require you to use this knowledge you have outside of school.. I will not lie though. SMU SIS is very rigorous and very tough. They push you to be the very best. You will cope not just with school work, but with external projects/clients/internships/jobs most of the time. This is what makes SIS unique.. To keep it short, SMU SIS' graduates are highly sought after not because of their GPA. But because of their amazing portfolio the students have, and their experience gained whilst their time in SMU.. Employers really do prefer SMU SIS graduates with a GPA of 2.9+ that has an amazing/incredible portfolio/ experience over a Full GPA student that has a sub par one.. (I gained this knowledge by talking to a friend in that school + hearing the director of the school talk.). 
Oh, one last tip:. All of SMU's courses throughout the school is Business Centric. FROM SIS, School of Econs, Social Sciences, Law, to School of Accountancy. Their modules mostly revolves around business.. But if you are keen to delve deeper into the Business curriculum, SMU is flexible enough to offer you a double major/degree on your second year on wards. You can also choose to appeal for a double degree from the start as well.. You don't have to worry because the curriculum structure allows you to study what you like Biz + IT without having to sacrifice in one are that you love, unlike NUS or NTU where their curriculum is more rigid and inflexible.. 
Hope that helps","

Because the SMU curriculum allows one to adopt a ""second major"", its pretty pointless most times to argue between taking econs, biz, accounting or even law. Unless you're going into an occupation such as an auditor, lawyer or economist, you'll probably do just as well as a Biz graduate if you go with a IS + Finance / Marketing / Econ second major. Some occupations like IB (the aspiration of nearly every SMU student) almost exclusively select based on your GPA.. The more normal occupations (reserved for common folks like me) such as banking middle office / back end / front office (sales) rarely care beyond you having a rudimentary understanding of Finance. As a matter of fact, having programming knowledge is a big plus. E.g. a IS + Marketing second major would probably stand a better chance at the job vis a vis a pure marketing grad, all other things being similar   since you will automatically be assumed to be a guru in social media and all things tech related. It's the same if your aspiration is in HR. You don't always need a specialised degree to do that although having one certainly helps your cause.. The above said, if you're not a GPA chaser (but then again, you will be if you're in SMU), by all means go for IS. It may not be much when compared to a traditional CS degree but its still something isn't it? It's a hard skill, not easily obtainable ( few people have the discipline to learn self programming), not easily replicable.","speaking as a ""lao jiao"" who's gone through the smu system (everything including its brainwash) and been out there in the workforce for a few years if i had a chance to redo it all over again i would most definitely go with is because the smu curriculum allows one to adopt a ""second major"" its pretty pointless most times to argue between taking econs biz accounting or even law unless you're going into an occupation such as an auditor lawyer or economist you'll probably do just as well as a biz graduate if you go with a is + finance / marketing / econ second major some occupations like ib (the aspiration of nearly every smu student) almost exclusively select based on your gpa the more normal occupations (reserved for common folks like me) such as banking middle office / back end / front office (sales) rarely care beyond you having a rudimentary understanding of finance as a matter of fact having programming knowledge is a big plus eg a is + marketing second major would probably stand a better chance at the job vis a vis a pure marketing grad all other things being similar   since you will automatically be assumed to be a guru in social media and all things tech related it's the same if your aspiration is in hr you don't always need a specialised degree to do that although having one certainly helps your cause the above said if you're not a gpa chaser (but then again you will be if you're in smu) by all means go for is it may not be much when compared to a traditional cs degree but its still something isn't it it's a hard skill not easily obtainable ( few people have the discipline to learn self programming) not easily replicable"

Accountant B has weak knowledge about book keeping and cannot get the basics of good keeping righ + has no experience.

That is why i m pointing out to you that most IS people are not technically competent . Most of the technical mods taught in IS barely scratched the surface of the technical side of IT field.(not even enough for real world application).. From a business point of view, yes they might know the processes involved and know the general idea on how various technologies work. But asking them to tweak/implement is often too difficult for IS major students.. I am not too sure how often have you worked with IS student. As a CS student, I am in constant interaction with IS students. You may ask any IS major students in SMU/NUS, majority will tell you that the mods that pull their grades down are technical mods..

""Will JC students struggle as they are without background in programming ??""  from my personal experience, I can safely say ""NO""(but that's dependent on that individual's willingness to learn).
I came from poly background and though I had programming as a basis, I feel like I am learning most things over again in here while seeing those JC students doing way better than myself.

Thanks","I believe whether or not you can take law as a second major is not completely up to you. I asked the dean, Steven Miller, about this at the interview. At SMU, you declare your second major depending on whether or not you have met the requirements to do so (i.e. successfully completed a certain number of modules for the particular major). I am unsure how the bidding system works, but the dean mentioned that sometimes it is not guaranteed that a student can get the modules (and therefore, the second major) he or she wants due to overwhelming response for the wildly popular ones.. As mentioned earlier by a senior, SIS has the highest drop out rate. Too many people go in thinking that they can smoke through the course because of its low COP. The dean himself said that he has seen many students entering SIS and regretting it. I had the opportunity to talk to a third year SIS student before the interview and he said that the workload is heavy. He even said to ""prepare to stay overnight many times at SMU if you come here"". Therefore if you dislike IT, I strongly recommend that you not take up the offer for your own sanity.","i believe whether or not you can take law as a second major is not completely up to you i asked the dean steven miller about this at the interview at smu you declare your second major depending on whether or not you have met the requirements to do so (ie successfully completed a certain number of modules for the particular major) i am unsure how the bidding system works but the dean mentioned that sometimes it is not guaranteed that a student can get the modules (and therefore the second major) he or she wants due to overwhelming response for the wildly popular ones as mentioned earlier by a senior sis has the highest drop out rate too many people go in thinking that they can smoke through the course because of its low cop the dean himself said that he has seen many students entering sis and regretting it i had the opportunity to talk to a third year sis student before the interview and he said that the workload is heavy he even said to ""prepare to stay overnight many times at smu if you come here"" therefore if you dislike it i strongly recommend that you not take up the offer for your own sanity"

419,SMU Information Systems Interview,pika98,"Mar 25, 2014", ,"My friend shared the interview experience(2014) with me. Here's the geist of what happened. Hope it helps future applicants!. Before the Interview
1. You wait in lobby then after all interviewees arrive, you enter a small room. A senior/prof will guide you.. 2. A write up form will be given to you. There are traits/qualities and description columns. Basically list a detailed example of each quality. The qualities might differ each year but you can refer to SMU SIS admissions page to prepare for the example/trait. Usually on curiosity, teamwork, etc. Also you write down 3 qns to ask the profs. Write fast.. 
3. Pass supporting documents, both the real and the photocopied for verification. After a short period of time, they would return you the copies for your keeping.. 4. Case Study (planning)
 basically about finding a solution to a ‘problem’
 it differs every interview so there's no pt trying to guess the case study qn
 there will be guiding pointers/qns to help you derive your solution
 15 min so write fast
 Given A4 sized paper for planning. Be neat when writing since you are using this for presentation.
 Toughest part of the entire interview, main thing is to think rationally and try to avoid obvious flaws in your plan because it will make your life tough in the presentation later. 
The Main Interview (in a bigger room). 1. Case Study(presentation)
 just go up to the projector and place your paper there and start presenting.
 ~4 min
 expect questions to be asked from the interviewers for them to understand your solutions better...usually they ask because your solution is not feasible in an aspect or your solution's objective is not clearly outlined. Hence the warning written earlier for planning stage.. 2. Local Context Estimation Question
 1 out of 16 qns that gets chosen
 best to provide figures while you explain. pls be smart and use easy figures.
 be able to explain your assumptions and process of getting your particular answer. the answer is not crucial but the explanation is.
 required to write your answer + explanation on paper. then state your thought processes out loud while the interviewers are going through it
 ~3 min. 3. Q&A session
 ask the profs the 3 qns or less. try to ask them rather than them prompting you, you'll give a gd impression and they tend to not ask you the harder qn later when its their time to question you.
 please do not ask questions which could be answered on their website
 be familiar /w your SMU submission's achievements section and your write up form as they may or may not ask you qns on that
 The interviewers may ask you general questions to know you better. Usually “Why SMU” and “Why SIS” and ""Whats your worst subject?"", ""Whats your weakness and your strength(in context of SIS)?"".  
Final Word: Be yourself is common advice but to be honest, in an interview, the most important thing is to be street smart. This means your interest level must be visible(no matter how bored you are with the other interviewee's speech, look @ them/the prof and feign interest) & be good at thinking on your feet/improvising. Because the profs do glance at what you are up to even when you are not saying anything. Ultimately, passion for IT is what they want to see and what you hopefully can show. The fact that you are here reading this is testament to your commitment to enter SIS. Preparing for an interview = half the battle won.
