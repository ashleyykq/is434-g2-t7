E-commerce websites use a recommender system that employs artificial intelligence and data science. It is a data filtering tool using machine learning algorithms to recommend the most relevant items to a particular user to increase user engagement and drive purchases.

This is an area of research that SMU SCIS Associate Professor Hady W. Lauw is working on. Learn more at smu.sg/predicted-recommendations

For this year's iteration, we had over 350 students from various Junior Colleges and High Schools joining us to explore and learn more about cybersecurity.

Day 1 commenced with an Opening Address from the Dean of SMU School of Computing and Information Systems, Dr. Pang Hwee Hwa. Following which, students got to learn more about various opportunities and interact with various industry professionals from Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies (CSIT), GovTech Singapore and Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) through Zoom sharing sessions and Discord villages.

The highlight of the event, an 8-hour Capture-the-Flag competition was held on Day 2. It began with a flurry of challenges being first blooded by various teams within the first hour alone! The competition remained very intense throughout the entire duration and we were heartened to see all the participating teams giving it their all as they battled for the top prizes.

We would also like to express our heartfelt thanks to our sponsors, Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies (CSIT), GovTech Singapore, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and Mandiant for supporting us in this event.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CalSMjWhhbE/,"With the pervasive use of technology across economy, society and polity, the demand for computing talent, including software engineers, has been increasing in Singapore and globally and is expected to remain high in the foreseeable future.

Starting August 2022, SMU School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS) will be launching the Bachelor of Science (Software Engineering) SkillsFuture Work-Study degree programme which combines classroom-learning with structured on-the-job training. It features a rigorous 52-week apprenticeship where undergraduate students work in development teams under the mentorship of professional software engineers. The collaboration with the programme’s first anchor partner - Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) – was formalised with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by Professor Pang Hwee Hwa, Dean of SCIS, and Mr D N Prasad, Senior Director of Strategy, People &amp; Organisation, GovTech.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CZG5y4ol9_Z/,"In the first of a five-week askST series on university education, senior education correspondent Sandra Davie addressed questions on university places – in particular, the sought-after spots for computer degree studies. In response to a parent's questions on what to consider when deciding between the various computing programmes offered across the different universities and asked for more information about computing degrees in SMU, SMU School of Computing and Information Systems and Lee Kong Chian Chair Professor of Computer Science Pang Hwee Hwa said the School currently offers four undergraduate computing programmes that target different job roles demanded by employers. He shared about the different focus of SMU's Computer Science degree; Information Systems degree; the BSc in (Computing and Law) in partnership with the SMU Yong Pung How School of Law; and a new computing degree in software engineering. Prof Pang advised students to first decide which area they would like to specialise in, and then consider the unique value propositions of SMU and the computing degrees it offers.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CYtXqylFQ0P/,"The 2021 challenge to develop technology-based solutions to reimagine learning experiences, in line with Singapore's focus on building diversity in schools and lifelong learning with digitalisation as a main tool, was clinched by The Circus, an all-female student team from SMU and NTU. The platform that SMU students Jennifer Poernomo, Jeanette Lee and Michelle Leong, and NTU student Ng Yan Qing are developing to connect students to study groups and matches tutors to students received the most appreciation from a panel of four judges at the second annual Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Sustainathon Singapore on Wednesday. 

The platform focuses on reimagining learning experiences. It also has a question-and-answer forum and provides study materials to connect students virtually. ""It was very hard for us to make friends in school with online classes, where all we know of our classmates are their names on a screen. We hope that our platform can start a culture of peer-to-peer learning during the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said Michelle.

Jing is a respected researcher and academic in natural language processing (NLP). She has published over 100 papers in many top-tier conferences and journals and chaired various academic conferences. Her work&nbsp;is in the application of NLP, proposing new solutions for a range of areas including information extraction, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, social media analysis, and most recently question answering.

Her research areas broadly fall into four directions: question answering, social media analysis, information extraction and domain adaptation.

A current topic she is researching on is the study of AI models especially for visual and verbal question-answer systems. This is necessary to enable machines to work together with people interactively through&nbsp;natural communications for joint problem solving.

It is also eyeing an initial public offering in the United States in the next 18 to 24 months. Aaron shared how the COVID-19 pandemic presented one of the company’s worst crises, but soon turned into an opportunity for growth.

&nbsp;
“I had graduated from a Diploma in Business Management from polytechnic. The usual route that people expect me to take would be&nbsp;a Degree in Business Management. However, after some deliberation, I decided to study Information Systems (IS) instead, as IT is becoming prevalent in our everyday life, I felt studying IS which is essentially IT in Business would be a more fulfilling journey&nbsp;for me,” said Fakhrul. He added that the decision was worth it. During his four years at SMU, he was actively involved in community work, clocking a total of 196 hours serving the community. He is also the first in the family to obtain a degree, an achievement&nbsp;which his family is proud of.

Carro joined the unicorn startup club in June when it completed a $360 million funding round that boosted its valuation to $1 billion. Aaron said Carro is just getting started, “The plan is to look to become a decacorn in the next few years, as soon as possible.” Aaron shared how he had been drawn to computers since his teens and even taught himself how to program and launched two startups, selling both so he could focus on his studies at SMU.&nbsp;

The team’s proposal is centered on the notion that the chat experience faced by a user makes or breaks the deal. Hence, they developed an application with sentiment analysis function that is able to detect negative languages as well as low-ball offers, to ensure deals between a buyer and seller are handled amicably.

Do check out the links to their application codebase:

The team’s proposal is centered on the notion that the chat experience faced by a user makes or breaks the deal. Hence, they developed an application with sentiment analysis function that is able to detect negative languages as well as low-ball offers, to ensure deals between a buyer and seller are handled amicably.

Reposted @alvinpohofficial •••••• Why Is Scaling A Business Hard?

This is a question I frequently asked myself when I was still starting out. Scaling is hard because of one’s perspective. Oftentimes, business owners focus on the wrong things when scaling… coming in with the intention of finding more clients and buyers (even worse, thinking of how to SELL your business immediately) is the wrong perspective.

Trust me, this is not the way to go.

“Okay Alvin…but exactly what should we focus on?”

In order to scale, one must go back to the basics! It may seem counter-intuitive…but think about it. How will you see exponential growth when you haven’t established a STRONG FOUNDATION?

Your foundation should be strong enough to withstand the growth you want to achieve. 

In my book, I’ll be talking about the 5 PILLARS you should focus on in order to scale, the same exact system I used for scaling my business to $30M!

Reposted @alvinpohofficial •••••• Why Is Scaling A Business Hard?

This is a question I frequently asked myself when I was still starting out. Scaling is hard because of one’s perspective. Oftentimes, business owners focus on the wrong things when scaling… coming in with the intention of finding more clients and buyers (even worse, thinking of how to SELL your business immediately) is the wrong perspective.

Trust me, this is not the way to go.

“Okay Alvin…but exactly what should we focus on?”

In order to scale, one must go back to the basics! It may seem counter-intuitive…but think about it. How will you see exponential growth when you haven’t established a STRONG FOUNDATION?

Your foundation should be strong enough to withstand the growth you want to achieve. 

In my book, I’ll be talking about the 5 PILLARS you should focus on in order to scale, the same exact system I used for scaling my business to $30M!

For this week’s #journeytowardsuccess, we spoke to Asher Chua, who works in Business Development at Impact. As a teenager, Asher was disinterested in school and underwent a rebellious phase which led to him dropping out at 15. Without having an O-Level certificate he struggled to find a stable job and went from one part-time job to another. Eventually, he decided to take his O-levels privately which helped him earn a place at RP pursuing Mobile Software Development. Despite, previously never enjoying studying his passion for tech helped see him through poly and even spurred him on to continue studying a course in a similar space at SMU. 

While Asher’s journey is unconventional it led to him discovering his passion and his career interests. Do read on to find out more about his journey!

The research study is designed as a quasi-experiment and will be conducted over 15 months. The sample will include 200 first year students who are enrolled in SMU's School of Computing and Information Systems.

Artificial Intelligence has been the talk of the town for the last decade and remains a hot topic among not only developers, engineers and data scientists, but also entrepreneurs and government bodies. It is a term you hear often and you might not realise it - AI has integrated into our lives as well. 

Let’s hear from Ke Xin, who is currently majoring in IT Solution Development (AI) at the School of Computing and Information Systems to tell us more about the major. 

What made you choose to take IT Solution Development (AI) as a major? 
I personally find AI something that intrigues me. Applications of AI can be found in our daily lives, such as Google Maps, Instagram's explore page, Netflix's recommendation, Apple's Face ID, and many more. Ever wonder how Google Maps works? How does it show you different paths you can take to reach your destination, how does it know the estimated duration of the trip, how does it ensure that the path you take will definitely bring you to the destination? The answers to these questions were previously obtained by flipping manually through the street directory, whereas now, with AI, it can be simply acquired with a few clicks away on your smartphone. 
 
What would you share with others who are considering to take AI as a major? 
I would encourage everyone who has an interest in AI and wants to make an impact on society in the future to go for it. It will not be easy, but it will definitely be a fulfilling experience! 
 
Any memorable AI-related modules or experiences you have undergone in SMU? 
Though it has only been a semester into our specialized tracks, and I have only taken an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence CS420, I was immediately captivated, and it has enhanced my interest in AI and the relevant fields. Through this module, I was taught the basics of AI such as Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing (NLP), but of course, I am aware that slides, textbooks, and theories are far from sufficient. Thus, my professor has also gone through Python and Jupyter Notebook files to ensure that we gain some exposure to what is expected in the real working world.",0,,2021-06-01T08:13:47.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/sgsmuscis,sgsmuscis,SMU SCIS,https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/195588016_465139487882797_780052967574373836_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=Kpo_h7zkQ64AX9vNYCe&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT-_JLMgMI5bF2AC950JUDV2lvOjoSm7x4IJY904irindA&oe=624D29B7&_nc_sid=86f79a,2586335398759668670,2022-04-01T17:20:41.693Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgsmuscis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi! 👋🏻 I’m Stephanie Winata, a Year 1 student from the School of Computing and Information Systems. When I’m not coding, I’m hosting with SMU Broadcasting & Entertainment and dancing with SMU Caderas Latinas. 
 
Amongst SMU’s many outstanding professors, my favourite this semester is Prof George Wong, teaching COR3001: Big Questions. He pushes us to think more deeply about the world we live in, encouraging us to chase our curiosities and never stop questioning why things are the way they are. Teaching about the local and global interactions of our world, Prof George skilfully breaks down the complex relations of the world around us into simple analogies, never failing to blow our minds every lesson. Filled with lively debates about Kpop, history and culture, his classes are the perfect way to end the week.

Here at SMU, we are huge advocates of a holistic University education. But what's in a name? Let Jodie, a student who has benefitted from SMU's holistic approach to education tell you all about it!

Q: Introduce yourself (name, year, course)
A: Hey there! My name is Jodie Ethelda, a Year 3 student pursuing a double degree in Information Systems (Artificial Intelligence) and Economics (Data Science & Analytics).

Q: Briefly describe your journey in SMU so far (majors, ccas)
A: My journey in SMU has been wonderful and fruitful. I was given the flexibility to take any double degree combination of my choice, which allowed me to pursue the fields which I found my passion for. SMU also offered me with meaning experiences for global exposure, where I was blessed to have been able to visit India for my OCSP and work with clients located in Germany for my study mission projects. 

Q: How has SMU supported your pursuit of a holistic University so far? 
A: After enrolling into SMU, I found myself to have grown both cognitively and socially. The SMU-X modules I have taken exposed me to working with both MNCs and SME clients, allowing me to learn from real-world issues faced by my clients within their industry as well as improve my people-management skills. Being part of the SMU Ambassadorial Corps has also widened my perspectives and expanded my network. Most importantly, the abundance of group projects in SMU has also attained me irreplaceable friends that have supported me through my SMU life.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CML4VCoFy3K/,"Artificial intelligence researchers and health experts modelling COVID-19's spread have warned that for vaccines to be useful in curbing the pandemic, a significant percentage of the population must be vaccinated to reach herd immunity. Professor Archan Misra pointed out at the SMU-Global Young Scientists Summit (GYSS) on 15 January 2021, from a purely self-interested point of view, each person would be best served if all the others got vaccinated and they themselves did not have to vaccinate – because that would stop the spread of the virus without their having to take on the possible risks of side effects. To account for these considerations, Professor Misra explained, the most powerful AI-based epidemiology models actually need to incorporate concepts from the behavioural sciences and game theory. 
&nbsp;
Discussing the influence of social sciences such as economics and psychology on AI, the panel, comprising of SCIS faculty Professor David Lo, Associate Professor Akshat Kumar and Assistant Professor Sun Qianru, concurred that AI researchers need to approach their work from an interdisciplinary angle and integrate knowledge from other fields to solve problems holistically.

Hi, I'm Shreyas :)
 
After graduating from SMU in 2019, I went on to pursue my graduate degree in Information Systems under the SMU - CMU Fast Track programme, before taking on a full time role at Adobe, as a Data Governance Analyst, in the SF Bay Area. 
 
To say where I'd like to go next is nearly impossible, having seen uncertainty caused by COVID-19, socially, economically and geopolitically. For now, I prefer to focus on continual learning and skills improvement, while seeking to create positive change, build new professional relationships, and navigate effectively through our brave new virtual world.

We caught up with Amelia Tay, a first year student, to hear what she has to say about her decision to join the School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS):

“I think that the SMU School of Computing and Information Systems @sgsmuscis is really unique! Initially, I was apprehensive about applying to SCIS as I did not have a coding background. However, the struggle and growth with my peers in SMU was what kept me going and pulled me through. I chose SMU mainly because of the degree of flexibility SMU programmes offer that isn’t as distinct in other universities. Here, I am not restricted to do anything I wish to pursue – with the exception of each day being limited to 24 hours.

Nonetheless, I’ve enjoyed a vibrant student life thus far – being a part of SMU FIDES, SMU Badminton Club, Growth-X Consulting as well as The Mentoring Circle have blessed me with good friends, opportunities, and a place to call home whenever I am on campus. It doesn’t hurt that SMU’s facilities are pretty and with plenty of wall sockets around too!”

However, the struggle and growth with my peers in SMU was what kept me going and pulled me through. I chose SMU mainly because of the degree of flexibility SMU programmes offer that isn’t as distinct in other universities. Here, I am not restricted to do anything I wish to pursue – with the exception of each day being limited to 24 hours.

Nonetheless, I’ve enjoyed a vibrant student life thus far – being a part of SMU FIDES, SMU Badminton Club, Growth-X Consulting as well as The Mentoring Circle have blessed me with good friends, opportunities, and a place to call home whenever I am on campus. It doesn’t hurt that SMU’s facilities are pretty and with plenty of wall sockets around too!”

It hopes to do so over the next two years via a new tech skills accelerator. The initiative would include a partnership with SMU that would see more than 1,000 of the school's undergraduates experience cloud-native technologies and content as part of their curriculum. Students from the SMU School of Computing and Information Systems would undergo classroom training as well as hands-on lab sessions to acquire ""practical technical skills"" in cloud-native practices and technologies.&nbsp;

[Alumni Story] In May 2019, following a rise in fake academic credentials, three individuals - Derrick Lee (SIS 2020), Gwendolyn Goh (SIS 2020) and Shaun John Cheetham (SIS 2020), founded Accredify. The team resolved to create an affordable solution that would revolutionise the world of identity and document management, and protect individuals from these fraudulent acts. Applying Accredify's technology, they created a robust system that can be easily permutated and customised for clients in various industries. 

One such instance was the collaboration with MOH and MOM in July 2020. Accredify developed a solution to verify COVID-19 discharge memos in the FWMOMCare mobile app. This helped to expedite their re-entry in the workforce. As of 31 Oct 2020, it has been verified more than 2 million times across Singapore! 

Reflecting on their success, they credited SMU that helped nurture their leadership and entrepreneurship skills. As Shaun shared, “Learning from professors who have a platitude of industry knowledge and experience certainly helped in ensuring that questions never went unanswered, and best practices shared.” The support had given them a kick-start into the business world.

Meet Our First Year: Chong Zhan Han

First-year student Zhan Han, formerly from Temasek Junior College, is an SMU School of Information Systems (SIS) Achievements Scholar studying Computer Science. He’s also interested in exploring possible 2nd majors such as IT Solution Management and Entrepreneurship – but he has plenty of time to decide!

“I chose SMU because of the city campus! It is located right smack in the middle of town, making it really accessible. I also appreciate that the faculty and staff members at SMU are extremely helpful and approachable, making it easy for students to seek help. Lastly, with the Computer Science programme in SMU, students are equipped with both technical rigour and strong business acumen, giving them the best of both worlds. So, these are some reasons why I joined SMU and I certainly hope to see you here soon!!”

https://www.instagram.com/p/CCZyYFEFoL1/,"SIS alumnus Marcus Wee is the founder of Aftershock PC (@aftershockpc), a homegrown company that specialises in custom-built, boutique PCs at accessible price points. When asked about his choice to study Information Systems at SMU, he professed that he “didn’t really put thought into it, but it turned out to be a good choice” as SMU focuses on presentation skills which he was lacking in. Feeling inspired by his gaming PC buying experience during his five-month student exchange at the University of Waterloo in Toronto, Canada during his second year of university, he presented the idea of Aftershock in his technopreneurship class when he returned to SMU, and partnered with his classmate to start Aftershock PC in 2012.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CCHxMRgFKTb/,"SIS Associate Professor Tan Hwee Pink is the co-principal investigator of a study which developed a novel and promising way to gauge seniors' cognitive functions by using a network of sensors to track their memory, movements and sleep patterns over a period of time. Describing the study results as promising, Assoc Prof Tan said the pilot study – the first of its kind in Singapore – is noteworthy given Singapore's rapidly ageing population and the growing number of elderly diagnosed with dementia. He added that the researchers wanted to detect mild cognitive impairment at an early stage, which could give a senior the best chance to reverse the impairment or at least delay the deterioration with appropriate treatment.

“Technical skills can be honed by time and grit, but the ability to think critically requires some guidance.”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Knowing that the industry he has chosen is a fast-paced one where “learning never stops”, SMU 2019 DBS Bank School Valedictorian in Information Systems Tan Kee Hock focused not only on studying the curriculum well, but also learning how to learn better. During his time in SMU, Kee Hock cultivated the habit of applying what he learnt in class into his daily life when trying to internalise new concepts, as well as taking his time when learning a new skill. He also made sure he passed down his knowledge by taking the role of a Teaching Assistant, where he took the initiative to guide his juniors through their curriculum requirements and project meetings.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CAttkRblnao/,"Commenting on how tech-savvy firms that can accelerate their digital transformation would have a better chance of surviving the Covid-19 pandemic unscathed, Hau Koh Foo, Director of SMU Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship said he has noticed how young people are often the first to transition to digital. ""I think what matters more is the ability to react fast. To be able to look at all the data that's coming and chart a path,"" said Mr Hau. One such firm with young leaders is UglyGood – co-founded by SMU alumni Clewyn Puah (Bachelor of Accountancy) and Jeremy Lee (Bachelor of Science in Information Systems) – which was in the business of recycling fruit waste. The company jumped in to fill the demand for hand sanitisers in February, when Singapore saw a shortage of the disinfectant. 🔗&nbsp;https://bit.ly/2M4PRAD

How did an SMU School of Information Systems student end up getting headhunted by Google?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It all started with a heart to help. Back in 2015, Vincent Tatan—one of @smu.sis’s pioneer batch of analytics graduates—had begun noticing many of his peers and juniors struggling with analytics. Inspired, he built an analytics application to help them learn, recorded Youtube training videos, and wrote insights articles on Towards Data Science—a free online platform for idea sharing. It was these articles which eventually drove traffic to Vincent’s LinkedIn page with readers reaching out to him for advice on data analytics, and made him the top recommended candidate for hiring companies, including Google.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“I really love to see growth in my juniors. I love learning and educating other people. And most of all, I love to give dreams to my juniors.”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

While completing a minimum of 80 hours of community service may be part of SMU’s requirement for all its undergraduates, it is always heartening to see how students take on such projects with pride and come away with fulfilling experiences.

SMU Business student Nicole Tay and @smu.sis students Masturah Binte Sulaiman and Park Ju Hee who have been volunteering at the Harvest Care Centre, have put together 3 important tips for future first-time volunteers:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1. Choose the programme which you are most interested in or passionate about.
2. Always keep an open mind and be ready to help.
3. Finally, volunteering might, at first, seem daunting or even intimidating.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B9qDLZplndC/,"”I signed up for a short term internship during the winter break in my penultimate year. I went in with zero expectation of getting a tech internship but miraculously I did and was posted to @landedvibe as a software engineering intern. This is by far, the most exciting internship I've taken. For that one month, I was tasked to design and implement a web calendar application to display the company's events. It was one serious rollercoaster ride. From learning new language and framework to implementation; it was learning on steroids. Fortunately, with hard work and determination, the final product was delivered on time. This would not have been possible without the help of my fellow intern @gilesccs. It has been a month of back breaking programming and continuous waves of jam packed Vietnamese culture. I felt fortunate to be able to take on one last software engineering internship before I graduate.” – Hong Yang, Bachelor of Science (Information Systems): Information Systems Student, 2016 Intake 🔗 Undergraduate admissions are open!

https://www.instagram.com/p/B80Idipl0Dv/,"“During the winter break of 2019-20, I went for an overseas internship with the IT team at Unit Assessment Center Indonesia PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. at Bandung, Indonesia, through AIESEC's Global Entrepreneur programme. I am very grateful to have been given this opportunity to experience Indonesia, its culture and its people personally. As I had embarked on this experience alone and being an introvert by nature, I often had to step out of my comfort zone and take the initiative to interact with the locals in a language that I am not familiar with. It was not easy but I did not regret any of my decisions. I faced each challenge bravely and ended these six weeks with no regrets. Hence, not only did I made lots of new friends and new networks, I've also learnt a lot of valuable lessons.” – Luo Wan Ting, Bachelor of Science (Information Systems): Smart-City Management & Technology Student, 2017 Intake

We also get the chance to know each other better. 
Among the different types of interactions with students, I enjoy mentoring them across longer-term projects (such as internships, research-based projects or final year projects) the most.

“It is essential to have talented individuals from different backgrounds coming forward and working towards a great cause.” Andre Ng | Associate Cybersecurity Specialist, Cybersecurity Group⁣
⁣
As a cybersecurity specialist, Andre works closely with system owners to ensure that their systems are secure and to help them with remediation efforts when a vulnerability is found. He also organises the annual Government Bug Bounty Programme, which involves engaging various teams of engineers, system owners and the cybersecurity community to discover vulnerabilities in local government systems.⁣
⁣
Surrounded by like-minded individuals who want to make a difference, Andre believes that open communication and understanding the needs of stakeholders are key to making the collaboration work. ⁣
⁣
Aside from the colleagues that he works with, here’s something others may not know about Andre:⁣
⁣
Tell me one thing people don’t know about you. ⁣
I only wear blue shirts to work, so that I have less decisions to make in the morning. ⁣

https://www.instagram.com/p/B4bczk9FoHY/,"As a Blockchain Developer at IBM, each day presents an exciting new challenge to SIS Alumnus Jaren Lim, from crafting the architecture of blockchain systems, programming smart contracts, to facilitating the needs of both back-end services and front-end clients.

Q: How has SIS experience contributed to your career development? 
A: The SIS pedagogy marries technical expertise with business acumen and social skills. In particular, SMU-X courses where we worked with real-world clients gave me the avenue to apply classroom lessons in a very tangible way. Internships were also an excellent opportunity to learn on the job, understanding the needs in the industry. Altogether, these experiences have allowed me to grow professionally and pursue a career of my choice. •
•
Q: What advice would you give to prospective students?
A: Focus on the learning and how to learn. ""Results are a by-product of your commitment and passion” - This was the advice given to me by Professor Steven Miller, the Founding Dean of SIS, during the SIS welcome reception. It challenged my perspective on academic grades and has served me well throughout my SIS journey. Many times, we find ourselves caught in a rat-race, seeking to compare our standing to others. ‘Learning-to-learn’ is an immensely powerful objective to hold, and this inspired me to devise my own success indicators in intellectual, social and personal spheres.

The battle over 5G and the emergence of deepfakes are just some of the latest tech that have big implications for U.S. foreign policy.

I'm glad to have worked with fellow Singaporean policymakers and friends from all over the world, coming together to learn about the U.S. political landscape and to formulate tech policy recommendations.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B3ti66bleSm/,"Congratulations to our SIS students Ker Wei Xiang, Patrick Lim and Darren Lim, for clinching&nbsp;second place at the 2019 CodeIT Suisse!
_ 
Wei Xiang represented the team to share their thoughts about the hackathon: “The CodeIT Suisse really opened our eyes to the world of competitive programming. It tested participants based on their ability to solve challenging computational problems efficiently and rapidly. In most institutions, we are taught to be relentless problem solvers but rarely do we deal with challenging logical problems. This competition allowed us to step out of our comfort zone and dive deep into the realm of algorithms and data structures, providing us an opportunity to apply what we have learnt in the ‘Computational Thinking’ course.”

Things don’t always work out as expected, Kar Way experienced a little hiccup during the trip for missing her connecting flight at the San Francisco International Airport, which resulted in increased travel time. In the realm of technology, smart automation would have been a relief to some of these process hiccups. At the conference, Kar Way presented how automation solutions can be applied to address growing challenge in surgery scheduling and bed management that confronted most public hospitals. One of the presented papers titled ‘Data Driven Surgical Duration Prediction Model for Surgery Scheduling: a case study for practice-feasible model in a public hospital’ was selected as one of the ‘Best Healthcare Paper Award’ finalists. Congratulations!

These simulations will retrieve and display streaming data from sensors (e.g. light, current, vibration) via color-coding, text, or real-time positional data (e.g. lift position). Ultimately, my working experience at DNV GL was largely insightful due to the diverse cultures and nationalities of the digital development team.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vSvcNlZHi/,"“Internship at the&nbsp;Singapore Land Authority's data and geospatial services division was truly an eye-opening experience for me. Working on a data harmonisation project enabled me to better understand the intricacies and challenges of managing spatial data. I was able to further develop my technical skills and practical knowledge, particularly in data management, and gain insights into industry best practices. Furthermore, I had the chance to work on various enterprise systems for data management, visualisation, and value-driven analytics to eventually enable and empower non-technical staff to conduct self-service analytics for business reporting. 
All in all, I am grateful for this internship experience and the opportunity to work with welcoming colleagues that were more than willing to help me along the way.😀&nbsp;” – Wong Xiao Rong, Bachelor of Science (Information Systems): Smart-City Management & Technology Student, 2017 Intake

Being in completely different faculties in SMU didn't stop them from finding each other through their love for K-pop. Meet Vera Sun (@SgSMUSOL undergrad), Janessa Sim (SMU.Accountancy undergrad), Moh Moh San (@SMU.SIS undergrad), the co-founders of @KpopKart—the first ever K-pop marketplace for fans all around the world to buy and sell K-pop merchandise.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Starting a business from a mere interest may seem frivolous to some but this is far from the truth for the trio: ""Targeting the niche market of K-pop was not a popular move to make. In fact, we received numerous sceptical comments about the scalability of the idea. However, with growing statistics of the K-pop market as well as increasing consumer demand for niche/personalised products, we believed in the huge potential of growth for KpopKart."" – Janessa
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Don't let setbacks and criticisms stop you from pursuing a potentially great idea. Take it from our three SMUggers here—with the right attitude and approach, you might find just the right formula. #Hwaiting!

One of the key takeaways I had as an intern was learning how technology plays an important role in the firm’s strategy. I had the opportunity to work and interact with technology professionals and senior leaders to understand how the different lines of business generate revenue for the firm. •

•
I also took part in J.P. Morgan’s Global Technology Innovation week with my fellow interns and had a first-hand experience of how ideas and innovations were generated across the firm. It has been a privilege to work in such a cultivating and innovative environment. Ending my stint will definitely feel bittersweet, but it gets me industry-ready.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B1KuH2tl1nS/,"As a Data Science Intern at JTC (@jtc_sg), Lionel was given the opportunity to work with the Digital Infrastructure team to build and maintain data pipelines, design application programming interface (APIs) to be utilised by the business users, as well as perform descriptive statistics and analysis to develop new insights for business’ needs. Let’s hear more of what he has to share about the internship.
•
•
•
💬 “As a major player in the real estate industry, JTC has given me the opportunity to understand the problems specific to the industry as well as the considerations in estate development in Singapore. With the vast amount of data available, I was exposed to real analytics problem in the industry and had the opportunity to put what I have learnt in SMU into practice to assist in the analytics project at JTC.
•
•
•
The internship experience was also a unique one as we got to visit some of JTC’s developments such as the Jurong Innovation District (JID) and Seletar Aerospace Park (SAP). During our trip to JID, we had meaningful conversations with employees of the various Advanced Manufacturing companies in the district that uses the Industrial Internet of Things in their manufacturing processes. We were also challenged by the HR team to brainstorm new technological ideas to enhance the living and working spaces in JTC – we worked in teams with interns from other departments and exchanged various ideas unique to our domain.
•
•
•
Overall, I had a lot of fun in JTC and my advice to all those who are embarking on their first internship is to go in with an open heart, learn as much as you can and don’t be afraid to speak to people across different domains. Something that was impressionable to me during my time at JTC was the initiative by my team to talk to different departments, which gave us a deeper understanding of the business processes in JTC and allowed us to form many meaningful connections in the company.” – Lionel Ng Ze Ji, Bachelor of Science (Information Systems): Information Systems Student, 2017 Intake

This is made possible in the partnership between Huawei (@huawei) and Infocomm Media Development Authority (@imdasg). We are glad to have our SIS Student Hui Chiann on board to share her thoughts about the 2 weeks trip. •

💬 “This summer, I was provided with the opportunity to visit Huawei’s headquarters in Shenzhen where I gained knowledge on the latest technologies in the industry (5G, cloud computing, AI etc) and exchanged views with like-minded students from other countries (Bahrain, Iraq and Cambodia). Through the intensive lessons, I had the chance to experience the workings of 5G technology firsthand and ultimately configured my own 5G base station. With 5G being rolled out in Singapore next year, this trip has definitely provided me with a head start!”

My biggest takeaway is the significance of communication with different stakeholders in a data analytics project to share data insights and understand the requirements of end users. I’m also very grateful to be able to work with friendly colleagues and mentors who guided me well and gave me the confidence to overcome any challenges. 
Above all, it was a unique opportunity to broaden my horizon in industrial development through intern site visits and learning journeys.

To my surprise, instead of traditional lecture hall, SMU uses seminar room which allow Professors to have close interaction with students. Personally, I feel having bi-directional communication makes things much more interesting as compared to omni-direction. The lectures are designed for interactive learning which encourage us to share our thoughts or doubts. 
Besides that, the bond with our ""SIS family"" is irreplaceable. To all incoming students, be open-minded and make time to socialise. You will find yourself within the SIS family circle in no time.

“Why did you choose SIS?” - We posed this question to some of the SIS freshmen during the Academic Briefing session held on 24 July, and here are some of their responses:
•
•
•
💬 “I have a keen interest in technology and previously graduated with the Diploma in Business Information Technology at Singapore Polytechnic, I wish to further continue my studies in the field of IT, to expand my knowledge and skill set.” - John Chow Li Wei (pictured on the left)
•
•
•
💬 “I chose SIS because I like the school environment and the well-connected location! Besides that, I look forward to attending the seminars as the professor to student ratio is small which I believe will be conducive to my learning.” - Elgin (pictured in the centre) •
•
•
💬 “I personally like the school’s core curriculum which teaches skills that are relevant and useful in the 21st century. In addition, I plan to enter the private industry in the future, hence I feel that the marriage between IT and business will be of great help!” - Yao Ying (pictured on the right)

•
•
•
👨‍💻 The competition enabled the team to see more clearly the role that technology plays in quantitative finance. “A computer is not only able to calculate and price financial instruments much faster than human beings, it is also able to automate many manual processes, such as algorithm generation and statistical scraping. This shows the importance of being technology-savvy even as a quant,” added Jorden. •
•
•
👩‍💻 The competition also opened the eyes of the team to the various ways to derive quantitative insights in the financial markets. “Some took their inspiration from biological processes,  thermodynamics, financial events and many more. It really shows that we are not only limited by our own creativity and knowledge”, Anita enthused.

•
•
💬 “Speaking from my experience as a Public Relations Director of the SMU EllipSIS student club, and&nbsp; having interacted with so many working adults and campus recruiters, I realised times have changed with the awareness and advocation of women in tech, especially in the past 5 years. Much has been written in the tech and business press about the positive change in expediting the promotion of women in tech such as proactive organisations focusing on gender parity and celebration of International Women’s Day. I would say our generation is non-conventional and more open to innovation. I believe in the future, maybe in the next 5-10 years, it will get better in terms of the gender imbalance as the next wave of leaders from our generation are the ones who will be leading this movement!”

•
•
💡 Their project was on Dynamic Keystroke Profiling for Identity Verification. Essentially, what their project does is to use Machine Learning to create typing profiles of people as a method of authentication. A hacker accessing your computer, for example, would be detected by the algorithm since their typing habits would be different from yours, and allow for action to be taken. •
•
•
👨‍💻 Through this competition, Zi Jie and Jorden learnt that innovative technology is not derived from blindly using AI or blockchain, but rather innovation lies in how the appropriate technology is deployed to tackle a problem from a different perspective.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BzpTv6QFpX-/,"SIS Student Mengru (@316316308l) revels in programming and writing code, she added that the collaborative and socially diverse environment at SIS has propelled her in her academic pursuits: “We often face stereotypes that males tend to outperform females in many areas, but we need to acknowledge that being interested in technology or computing is not just a male quality. Digital technology in particular is now so deeply embedded in all our lives that from a consumer perspective, there really is no gender divide. Thankfully, my peers in school are supportive and display great team camaraderie. For instances, we help to counter-check for errors in our codes before submissions, and are willing to share our notes before midterms and finals. These are little gestures that mean a lot to me.”

It’s Cody the owl – our very own mascot. 🦉
_ “While I know that the technology sector is mainly dominated by males, I am not affected by the gender disparity and I have never belittle myself just because I’m a woman pursuing a degree in Information Systems. I hope that my fellow ladies out there would share the same thought - never let your gender define or limit your decision. Just be YOU.
_

Just like how digital trends are always evolving for the better, the curriculum at SIS is constantly revamped to stay relevant and align to meet the needs of the industry. It is something that I personally feel is crucial in the technology field. Besides that, more importantly than the course content taught, the school cultivates one to be a self-driven learner and I believe this ‘learning-to-learn’ attitude would serve us, regardless of gender, a competitive advantage when we start working in the corporate world.”

_ “Gender imbalance in the field of technology is apparent and is also not surprising that the males outnumber the females in my cohort. However, that does not dissuade me to pursue a degree at SIS. 
Being a woman does not define your ability to code. I strongly believe that the gender gap in the tech industry should not be a deterrence for women's entry but an inspiration for a new frontier of women in tech. To be honest, as a student coming from a Science background, the tech industry is not somewhere I would have envisioned myself in. Nevertheless I took the leap and the learning journey so far has reignited my interests in computing, and has definitely advanced my skillsets in IT and business innovation. What's more, I especially love the friendly and inclusive environment where there is equal opportunity for all!” _

•
“These few years we have seen conversations about gender equality being pushed to the forefront which sparked positive changes across multiple industries, and this includes the tech industry. More and more tech giants are encouraging women to take part in tech innovations, and we also see more women being hired in firms to encourage diversity in the workplace. However, I think more needs to be done to narrow this gap. •
•
It was never about your gender, but your interest and how much effort you put into it. Sometimes we need to stop thinking if certain tech areas are more suited for guys or girls but focus on what you can bring to the table. I think that is more important.”

_ 
Vinnie is majoring in the Smart-City Management and Technology programme, and her interests lie in technology and its repercussions on urban planning and society. This is what she has to say about the inclusive and collaborative community at SIS: •
•
“I have been blessed with a very supportive network of friends and professors who have given me many opportunities to hone my skills and explore new technologies of my interest. These include dabbling into Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics to build solutions such as a Smart Facilities Management System, which utilises light, humidity and temperature sensors to improve conditions and achieve energy efficiency in study areas. 
Apart from experimenting with new technologies, SMU has also given me many enriching opportunities to give back to the society. A good example is my involvement in Project Heartcode (@smuheartcode), a community service project that gave me the chance to share my knowledge and teach the underprivileged youth basic web development and IoT. •
•
I am truly glad that the school recognises the importance of diversity in this digital revolution. And here’s to a lifelong journey in tech with more experimentations and solutions created to better the lives of people!”

Do you know that we have a common space in our campus known as the ""SIS Project Way""? (Swipe to see more 📸) It is a place for us to unplug to recharge. Most of the SIS students will gather there to do projects, exchange ideas and share our knowledge with one another. You can also see moments of frustration (😡debugging in process...), stress (😥 mugging for exams) and joy (🙃 celebrating accomplishments, 🎂 birthdays, etc.). _

Besides the facilities, I also like how SIS electives give us a holistic experience in both tech and management, equipping us with the 💡 future-ready career skills. What’s more, we also have the privilege to access to a diverse range of databases at the SMU Libraries (@sgsmu.library), and opportunities to work with industry partners through SMU-X courses!” ✌🏻

_

During the themed hackathon, participants were grouped in teams to collaborate and develop Internet-of-Things driven prototypes to address urbanisation issues. Each team was provided with a Micro:bit which is a pocket-sized codable computer with built-in sensors to detect properties such as motion, light and temperature. 
_

At the end the day, each team was given a chance to pitch their ideas and demonstrate their accomplishments to the panel of industry leaders. All in all, the hackathon showed one thing above all else – a promising idea first starts with a deep understanding of the diverse needs of the end users, and thereafter synthesising IT solutions to facilitate efficiency and improve sustainability of a Smart City.

During the themed hackathon, participants were grouped in teams to collaborate and develop Internet-of-Things driven prototypes to address urbanisation issues. Each team was provided with a Micro:bit which is a pocket-sized codable computer with built-in sensors to detect properties such as motion, light and temperature.

He has been rehearsing his dance moves for months on end, and all hyped up for the dance production in May, with SMU Eurhythmix (@smuemix) - a hip-hop dance club of SMU. 
When asked about the fondest memory of studying in SIS, Abdul Haqqim specially mentioned the MetamorphoSIS Camp (@smu.metamorphosis), the Freshman Orientation Camp that gave him the headstart to his university days. He still recalled how he was worried back then about the lack of knowledge in coding. But thanks to the strong spirit of friendship forged through the camp, and the nurturing culture of peer support, he was able to keep up with his studies.

Learning doesn’t just stop in the classroom. Besides keeping up with her studies, SIS final year student Sally Chin (@sallycsy) also took up a part-time internship at Microsoft as a Partner Technology Strategist. Her role entails working with customers and business partners to align their technology roadmaps with Microsoft-based solutions and technologies priorities, enabling them to realise the vision of digital transformation.
_ 
Gaining the internship experience under her belt has definitely helped Sally to take the first step into the corporate world. She has worked with a range of clients on real projects, and made meaningful connections with people along the way. She shares, ‘Whenever you run into any sticky situations, do not be afraid to reach out to people around you. When we’re open to learning from others, we benefit from their experience as well as our own.’ Coincidentally, even her mentor at work was an SIS alumnus!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BvdKv2aFFOr/,"The heat is on but Yixi (@yixii_) is glad she is not fighting this battle alone. 
_ 
She has recently concluded a series of events – the most recent one being SIS Finals Welfare Drive and Patron's Day 2019. Besides juggling academic projects and final submissions, Yixi has kick-started her summer commitments that includes the logistical planning for MetamorphoSIS Camp (@smu.metamorphosis - SIS Freshmen Orientation Camp) and SMU Broadcast & Entertainment (@smube) Voice Personality Hunt. 
_
Amid her busy schedules, hear what Yixi has to say about the diverse opportunities at SIS: “There are opportunities for every SIS student no matter where your interest lies. It could be something that is academic-related – for instance, joining Special Interest Groups such as Business Intelligence & Analytics (BIA) Club (@smu.bia) and Whitehats, help students meet like-minded individuals through workshop and activities. If you are an event enthusiast like me who wants to contribute back to the SIS community, being a part of the SMU EllipSIS (@smuellipsis) has been a great experience so far. The first event I participated was ExploreSIS 2018, an outreach day camp for Poly and JC students. As part of the organising committee, it was really satisfying seeing participants enjoying themselves through the coding workshop and games that we planned out for them. So don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and pick up a new skill that you have always wanted to try!” _

.
Prior to joining SIS, he had no background in technology and programming, and he recalled it was one of the greatest worries he had back then as an incoming student. No doubt the journey of any SIS Student will not be a walk in the park, but Manny believes that approaching it with an open mind and a desire to learn will come a long way. He recounted how the school prepares and grooms their students not just in terms of academics and technical knowledge, but also the emphasis of soft skills that allow one to hit the ground running when they enter the workforce.
.
To gain the most of his experience in SIS, Manny joined the EllipSIS (@smuellipsis), a student representative body for the school. He was the Events Director for the 13th executive committee, and that stood him a good stead to host networking sessions, interact with companies and seek potential career opportunities. Besides that, Manny also attributed his achievement to Project HeartCode, a community service project dedicated to underprivileged youths of Singapore, giving them an opportunity to experience and pick up valuable technical skills like Web Development and Internet-of-Things (IoT). #smusis&nbsp;#SchoolofInformationSystems #ComputingatSMU&nbsp;#InformationSystems #SmartCityManagement&nbsp;#Technology #Innovation #ComputerScience #ComputingandLaw",1,36,2019-03-22T02:27:04.000Z,,,Photo,https://www.instagram.com/sgsmuscis,sgsmuscis,SMU SCIS,https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/53467354_316530015727949_4844896854109766913_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=J5U8D7IXfbcAX8EeUv0&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT_4SFTm0w5lJEtijpBI4rfn_68vRHfDtwZoWiTx-Ytm8g&oe=624E26D4&_nc_sid=86f79a,2004890756541005877,2022-04-01T17:21:00.526Z,https://www.instagram.com/sgsmuscis,,,"Manfred ""Manny"" Loh 🦣",abundanceofmanny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Professor Venky Shankararaman started the dialogue by sharing how technology has a transformative and disruptive effect in almost every industries which includes the legal sector. With the technological changes and opportunities brought upon by the deployment of artificial intelligence, we need to position ourselves to better understand the legal, regulatory and compliance landscape within which the technology operates.

Last but not least, a BIG thank you to the committee of SMU Whitehacks Society for the utmost effort in managing the event. Thank you to all the attendees for spending the weekend with us to experience the learning pedagogy and interact with our SIS students and faculty. We hope you find your inner hacker, and we look forward to seeing you again in our future events! 🤗

All work and no play makes jack a dumb boy, but that doesn’t apply to SIS Freshie James Looi (@jormasloot). Although he is preoccupied with upcoming project submissions and presentations, that doesn’t deter him from taking the time to unplug and recharge. During his leisure time, James engages in activities hosted by SMUX Skating team (@smuxskating) where they will have weekly skating sessions at various dinner spots all over Singapore. 
_
Besides that, James is also in the executive committee for SMU Whitehat Society, a special interest group founded by a group of students who are passionate about cybersecurity. At the moment, he is working on the finishing touches for Whitehacks 2019, an outreach program for the Junior College students, and that is happening this weekend!

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bundq8xFYy2/,"Our BSc (Computer Science) Programme Director Hady recently conducted a workshop on “Supervised Learning via Linear and Logistic Regressions” to a group of Year 6 students from NUS High School. 
_
Supervised Learning, in the context of Artificial Intelligence, is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a known dataset to make predictions. To better grasp the concept, students were taught how to apply the various types of learning paradigms such as ‘Regression’ and ‘Classification’ through a few tutorial exercises on Scikit-learn.
_
The 3-hour workshop was concluded with a competition, which involves students getting their hands to test the datasets, train the models and make predictions of the rental prices of properties in Singapore.

Supervised Learning, in the context of Artificial Intelligence, is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a known dataset to make predictions. To better grasp the concept, students were taught how to apply the various types of learning paradigms such as ‘Regression’ and ‘Classification’ through a few tutorial exercises on Scikit-learn.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BukakqaFcTG/,"Good news to start off the week! Team TankBellCurve has emerged as the runner-up in EY Asia-Pacific Cyber Challenge 2019!
_

The team of 4 comprising of members across three different batches of SIS cohorts are united by the interest in Cybersecurity. 
_ 
Here’s what they have to say: “The competition was both exhilarating and challenging. Over the course of the hackathon, we encountered subjects which we are not familiar with. We struggled and had to learn along the way. We had to assimilate knowledge quick and apply them in the right context. It was against all odds, in which we matured. It was never about winning but rather the learning process. 
One of the key takeaways is never give up. It was through sheer tenacity which allowed us to progress through the competition. We are thankful for the overseas experience and would like to express our deepest gratitude to SIS, for all the support and opportunities given to us in this cyber hackathon organised by @eysgcareers”

https://www.instagram.com/p/BtR-s7jl6cs/,"“Unlearn, Relearn and Learning to Learn.” - This is one of the key takeaways for Jacey Teoh, a student from the Eunoia Junior College who attended Women in Tech held on 25 January 2019. 
_

One of the most exciting aspects of having a career in information technology is how it overlaps with so many industries. This means the possibilities are endless, you can find work in just about any sector you like. However, while the digital revolution is in full swing, there is a serious shortage of women working in tech companies. 
_

A panel discussion on ‘Women Making a Difference with Technology’ brings to light the under-representation of women and how it is pertinent to empower them in technology from the classroom to the boardroom.
_

Jacey also recounted her experience of building MRT stations and mapping distance routes by plotting a Voronoi diagram in the hands-on workshop conducted by Associate Professor Zheng Baihua.

He probably gets that a lot.  After he spelled it out, he told me his website name is www.dattas.net I don’t think anyone can top that when you see which course he’s teaching.
.
Q: What are you teaching this term at SIS?
A: Data Management, a core course for first year students in Information Systems major.
.
Q: What do you do in your free time?
A: I write. I’ve written 2 books, the first was on large scale software systems - Metrics-Driven Enterprise Software Development.  The second was a college textbook on Software Engineering.  I’m working on my third book on making sense of data, how we can be more informed users of information. The book is a bridge between popular science and a textbook. There will be some hands-on, skills-based tools like R programming.
.
Q: What sports do you play?
A: Cricket.  I don’t really play these days but I still watch cricket.
.
Q: What’s your favourite film genre?
A: I prefer to read compared to movies or Netflix because I have too much screen time daily.
.
Q: How would your friends describe you?
A: I consciously seek out friends who are different from me. In life, all the interesting things come from the weak ties we have.  This is based on a paper The Strength of Weak Ties” by Mark S. Granovetter. .
Q: What would you do even if you weren’t paid any money?
A: Write!  Books have important appeal in reaching out to people, especially un-like-minded people.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BtOGUsYFa7n/,"SIS Faculty Feature. Upon entering Senior Lecturer Siaw Ling’s office, one is struck by how colourful it is, from the items on her desk to the balloons she saved from an event which lined her otherwise empty bookcases.  After all, she has just joined SIS less than 2 months ago. I shot the usual questions to Siaw Ling and I was pleasantly surprised when I didn’t get the usual answers back.
.
Q: What do you teach at SIS?
A: Analytics Foundation and Digital Analytics Technology, to year 2s and 3s.
.
Q: I see lots of colours. Tell me about the balloons on the bookshelves.
A: (Laughs) they’re from a Digital Analytics event by Google. The helium balloons slowly sank to the ground. Colours brighten up my office and the balloon shape ties in with data visualisation where I tell stories with charts.
.
Q: What do you do in your free time?
A: I like to be outdoors with my family at parks, cycling through park connectors.
.
Q: What would you do even if you weren’t paid any money?
A: Draw!  I draw black and white pictures with pencil and pen.  My favourite comic is Calvin and Hobbes.
.
Q: Complete this sentence - “At home, I am the go-to person for…”
A: My kids always ask me to help them with their art. They always ask me, do these colours go together?  I am also the go-to person for fashion styling because I like recommending outfit combinations to my kids. Maybe I would be a fashion stylist if I wasn’t a lecturer?! (Laughs).
.
Q: What workouts do you do to stay fit and healthy?
A: Walking.
.
The interview ended with talk about the weekly brisk group which a few SIS staff join. Welcome again to SIS, Siaw Ling!

Q: What do you teach at SIS?
A: Web Application Development and Foundations of Cybersecurity.
.
Q: You’re new at SIS, made any friends yet?
A: David Lo (short pause) I know from before I joined SIS, Subhajit who is also new and Yingjiu, I work with.
.
Q: What is your favourite film genre and do you follow any series?
A: Sci Fi.  I follow Black Mirror on Netflix but I try not to start because it’s difficult to stop.  I like Japanese Anime also and I've been watching Naruto for more than 20 years.

Q: What do people say you’re good at?
A: I’m friendly and hope the students find me approachable. I like to create a friendly environment.

Q: What workouts do you do to stay fit and healthy?
A: Walking, swimming, stretching. I haven’t checked out the swimming pool, I hear there’s one at Admin building. I don’t have time to workout and I spend a lot of time sitting and working so I take short breaks to stretch and do some push ups and crunches (gestures to workout mat at the corner of his office and we proceeded to talk about effective bodyweight exercise moves).

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Prof Hwee Xian gave an overview of IoT and conducted a hands-on workshop on Smart Sensors, Smart City. Participants used BBC micro:bit for the exercises and SIS students were on hand to assist participants. Participants worked on examples such as smart urban farming (are the vegetables getting enough sun?) And elderly tracking (e.g. has the elderly person with dementia wandered off from his/her caregiver?).
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Next up were SIS alumni  Hanwen and Songwei, where their reasons for joining SIS had the room laughing, along with their respective experience at SIS and work life so far. Participants broke for lunch and visited project booths. And it's a wrap for Day 2 of Zero to Hero

https://www.instagram.com/p/BqyuO19FAaF/,"At 10:30 a.m. when we met at Live Labs, Prof Rajesh had already finished 4 meetings. His first meeting was with a health analytics startup.  Second meeting was with MIT to work on items for startups he’s helping.  Third meeting was with an UX designer to design an app.  Fourth meeting was with the CEO of his startup wrt launch. As his fifth appointment for the day, I asked what the rest of his day was looking like. Rajesh will be meeting a visitor from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, might be attending a PhD dissertation defense session, followed by an interview with BBC. When I congratulated him on being named ACM Distinguished Member recently, he quipped in a self-deprecating way, “It just means I’m old.”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Questions and Answers with Rajesh:
Q: What are you currently working on in research?
A: Large scale sensing (passive sensing and analytics mechanisms) to detect and correct stress and depression among students.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Q: Tell me more about the startups?
A: For the startup on indoor location positioning and location analytics, the technology has been used by a museum, at a convention centre, at some universities in Singapore and overseas and a pest control company. I needed something to manage conference attendance so I came up with a conference app. Turns out there was a demand for a large scale conference app so we’ve sold that to a few people. The app has been used to manage events with 30,000 participants.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Q: What do you teach at SIS?
A: Software engineering for the longest time and now software project management. There’s an exam coming up then I have to do grading.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Q: What do you do in your free time?  Do you watch movies?
A: Play with my son. [shows me photo of a super cute 3-year old.] I don’t have time to watch movies. The only time I catch up on a movie is on a plane and I prefer to read.  I read science fiction, fantasy...I read things that generate ideas.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Thank you Rajesh!

Remember that holiday when you couldn’t sleep because it was too noisy? Teams “No Sleep” and “MinusDB” worked on addressing high noise levels with real time monitoring and countering high noise levels with white noise.

With the aim of improving overall escalator safety and lowering maintenance costs for their stakeholder, “Project Esc” used data from temperature, light (gaps in steps), accelerometer readings (vibration) and range to come up real-time monitoring of escalators and prediction of potential escalator faults.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Alleviating bored children accompanying their parents shopping since Nov 2018, team “BitMonsters” developed a game for their stakeholder where kids wear a device and catch BitMonsters for points which shoppers can redeem for small prizes. Spawning Bitmonsters for capture at different locations within the mall encourages shoppers and their offspring to explore parts of the mall with low traffic.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Drivers have a heads up on available lots at car parks with screens around the city.  Enter “Tissue Issue”, the food court version.  Tissue Issue’s system monitors a food court by camera and tells patrons how many seats are available. The system also detects overcrowded periods and suggests alternative dining timings for patrons.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Team “MarkeThings” worked on monitoring consumer behaviour patterns to see which merchants and promotions are the most effective. In their project, a designated zone would be set up for shoppers to use promo codes to redeem their vouchers.  Data on foot traffic and consumer behaviour is collected for evaluating marketing strategy.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The Quintuplets team looked at child safety at a theme park, With “Easy & Secure Tracking” (E.A.S.T.), kids are less likely to get lost.  Young kids wear beacons in the form of wristbands and receivers placed around the entire theme park allow parents to track their kids’ location.

Remember that holiday when you couldn’t sleep because it was too noisy? Teams “No Sleep” and “MinusDB” worked on addressing high noise levels with real time monitoring and countering high noise levels with white noise.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
With the aim of improving overall escalator safety and lowering maintenance costs for their stakeholder, “Project Esc” used data from temperature, light (gaps in steps), accelerometer readings (vibration) and range to come up real-time monitoring of escalators and prediction of potential escalator faults.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Alleviating bored children accompanying their parents shopping since Nov 2018, team “BitMonsters” developed a game for their stakeholder where kids wear a device and catch BitMonsters for points which shoppers can redeem for small prizes. Spawning Bitmonsters for capture at different locations within the mall encourages shoppers and their offspring to explore parts of the mall with low traffic.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Drivers have a heads up on available lots at car parks with screens around the city.  Enter “Tissue Issue”, the food court version.  Tissue Issue’s system monitors a food court by camera and tells patrons how many seats are available. The system also detects overcrowded periods and suggests alternative dining timings for patrons.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Team “MarkeThings” worked on monitoring consumer behaviour patterns to see which merchants and promotions are the most effective. In their project, a designated zone would be set up for shoppers to use promo codes to redeem their vouchers.  Data on foot traffic and consumer behaviour is collected for evaluating marketing strategy.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp4oS2ilcrG/,"Venky ran through a typical day in his life as Deputy Dean and it went something like this: MOE query on SIS curriculum through SMU’s Office of Corporate Communications and Marketing. Provost wanted final set of courses under Technology and Society basket and programme direction. Work on presentation for outreach event. Review book chapter on a book he’s co-authored.  Prepare for new course next term - Enterprise Solution Development (core course for Year 2s). Collected fitness tracker to take part in corporate challenge.  Work to be done as President Elect and Conference Committee Chair for AIS SIGEd 2018 Conference (12-13 Dec, in San Francisco). Industry collaboration - train the trainer session. Academic related housekeeping.  Interaction with students.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
3 Questions and Answers with Venky:
Q: Phew. That sounds non-stop. And a lot of moveable parts.  What do you do to decompress?
A: Walking - I do a lot of walking (Mount Faber, Bukit Timah, MacRitchie, etc). Vedic chanting. I appreciate music (western and Indian classical) and plays especially comedy. And I watch Netflix.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Q: What was the last play you watched?  And what do you watch on Netflix?
A: The play Souvenir (about the infamously bad soprano singer Florence Foster Jenkins) was funny.  On Netflix I’ve been following The Rain and I like history-based drama.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Q: What are you good at and you enjoy doing?  What would you do even if you weren’t paid for it?
A: I like making people happy. I would teach for free whether in Singapore or abroad.  I am good at taking something complex and making it easy to understand.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BpHbklfnNJm/,"Lingxiao won the ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award for 2018 for the co-written Deckard paper published in 2007 when he was a PhD student at UC Davis. The name Deckard reveals Lingxiao’s favourite film genre (sci fi) and favourite film (Blade Runner). We had a good discussion (read: he explained, I listened) about code vectorization back in 2007 and today with deep learning.  This post rounds up with a few questions for Lingxiao:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Q: What do you teach at SIS?⁣⁣⁣
A: Enterprise Solution Design⁣⁣⁣.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Q: What do people tell you you’re good at?⁣⁣⁣
A: (Pauses and really thinks about the question.) When I was a younger, my parents praised me for being good at maths, it meant I was paying attention in class (laughs).
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Q: What do you do in your free time? ⁣⁣⁣
A: (laughs again) Before kids - I used to play badminton and table tennis with my wife. After kids - family activities.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Q: What do you enjoy doing?⁣⁣⁣
A: I enjoy teaching my son to code (Scratch) but I don’t know if he enjoys it (laughs).
