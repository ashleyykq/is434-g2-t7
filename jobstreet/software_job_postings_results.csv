In Germany, we predominantly supply hospitals, GPs’ surgeries, emergency services and corporations. Since 2007, Fleischhacker has also been distributing its MediConnect® software – a comprehensive solution for the management of clinical processes in hospitals and in GPs’ surgeries.</p><p><strong>What Makes Us Different</strong></p><p>It comes down to well-grounded know-how and comprehensive expertise within the hospital sector. Having extensive experience in equipping clinics and surgeries coupled with a high capability to streamline structures, we are able to optimize your processes. It is this optimization that encapsulates the quality of consulting and advice we offer. This extends from our belief that the key to securing substantial progress and quality in health care is achieved through the reorganization of clinical routines in hospitals through cutting edge processes, intelligent connections and innovative standardization.</p><p>Yet Fleischhacker is more than just a service provider. We are a partner you can trust. Our expertise extends to you by maximizing the quality of services you provide. For example, the modular planning of hospitals in developing countries, with its associated infrastructural challenges and medical problems, requires a high degree of structuring complex processes. We have the means to contribute substantially to this kind of project planning with our specialized experience, intuition and sensitivity.</p>","<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Job Responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Design, Test and Verify to ensure user application and server side components meeting requirements and functional specifications;</li><li>Execute Unit, Regression, Integration, Performance and System Tests;</li><li>Work with software developers regarding test procedures and results to resolve issues;</li><li>Ownership of the assigned modules/ projects;</li><li>Perform defect tracking management and follow through with solutions;</li><li>Update tasks done in OpenProject;</li><li>Set up and maintain databases, take regular backups and restore as needed;</li><li>Participate in software feature design review, prepare and publish test reports for software releases (both major and minor releases);</li><li>Review software documentation to ensure technical accuracy and completeness;</li><li>Design and implement tests using scripting languages and other tools used in manual testing environment;</li><li>Conduct research on project related topics if required.</li></ul><p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>Degree in Computer Science/Information Technology or related discipline;</li><li>Working knowledge on Microsoft SQL Server, JENKINS, TestComplete or HL7 will be advantageous;</li><li>Outstanding organizational and time management skills;</li><li>Analytical thinker and problem solver;</li></ul><p>We regret to inform that only shortlisted candidates will be notified.</p>","['Professional and personal development', 'Collaborative work culture', 'Work-life harmony']",Junior Executive,,3 years,"Diploma, Advanced/Higher/Graduate Diploma, Bachelor's Degree, Post Graduate Diploma, Professional Degree, Master's Degree",,Full-Time,,"['Dental', 'Medical', 'Regular hours, Mondays - Fridays', 'Smart Casual']",https://myjobstreet.jobstreet.com.sg/application/online-apply.php?job_id=9363205&advertisement_id=9361576&s=20&AdvertisementSource=1,701710,Toa Payoh,sg

By choosing not to design, manufacture or market any semiconductor products under its own name, the Company ensures that it never competes with its customers. And so, the key to TSMC’s success has always been to focus on its customers’ success. TSMC’s foundry business model has enabled the rise of the global fabless industry, and since its inception TSMC has been the world’s leading semiconductor foundry. The Company manufactured 11,617 different products using 281 distinct technologies for 510 different customers in 2020.</p><p>TSMC-made semiconductors serve a global customer base that is large and diverse and includes a wide range of applications. These products are used in a variety of end markets including mobile devices, high performance computing, automotive electronics and the Internet of Things (IoT).

These facilities include four 12-inch wafer GIGAFAB® fabs, four 8-inch wafer fabs, and one 6-inch wafer fab – all in Taiwan – as well as one 12-inch wafer fab at a wholly owned subsidiary, TSMC Nanjing Company Limited, and two 8-inch wafer fabs at wholly owned subsidiaries, WaferTech in the United States and TSMC China Company Limited.</p><p>In May 2020, TSMC announced its intention to build and operate an advanced semiconductor fab in the United States, in order to better support customers and partners there as well as to attract global talents. This facility, to be built in Arizona, will utilize TSMC’s 5-nanometer technology for semiconductor wafer fabrication and will have a capacity of 20,000 semiconductor wafers per month. Construction is planned to start in 2021 with production targeted for 2024.</p><p>TSMC provides customer support, account management and engineering services through offices in North America, Europe, Japan, China, and South Korea.
