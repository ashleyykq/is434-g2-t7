	The Bioinformatics Institute (BII) is a research institute under A*STAR’s Biomedical Research Council, and it is conceived as the computational biology research and postgraduate training institute as well as a national resource centre in bioinformatics. The BII focuses on theoretical approaches aimed at understanding biomolecular mechanisms that underlie biological phenomena, the development of computational methods to support this discovery process, and support experimental verification of predicted molecular and cellular functions of genes and proteins with biochemical methods.</div>","<span>Project Description:</span> Training deep learning (DL) models on multiple heterogeneous tasks is one of the main steps in the direction of offering robust and generalizable AI solutions. We are seeking a postdoctoral research fellow to participate in an exciting collaboration between the Bioinformatics Institute (BII), the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) and Singapore General hospital. The aim is to design an AI model that can help hospitals by learning a diverse set of diagnostic tasks such as breast cancer grading and prostate gland segmentation as tasks are introduced through time. An AI model that is sufficiently smart to optimise the required network resources and to reduce the necessary dataset size to deliver a desirable performance for each task. To achieve these objectives the proposed AI model should be novel in many aspects. For instance, it should automatically decide which part of the network to assign to a new task, it should automatically expand itself if necessary to learn a new task, it should find similarities between tasks and share resources between similar tasks and it should avoid sharing resources between dissimilar tasks. We look for a creative mind with strong communication skills.

The platform includes marketing, sales, service, operations, and website management products that start free and scale to meet our customers’ needs at any stage of growth. Today, more than 128,000 customers across more than 120 countries use HubSpot’s powerful and easy-to-use tools and integrations to attract, engage, and delight customers.</strong></p><p><strong>Named Glassdoor’s #2 Best Place to Work in 2022, HubSpot has been recognized for its award-winning culture by Great Place to Work, Comparably, Fortune, Entrepreneur, Inc., and more. HubSpot was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company’s thousands of employees work across the globe in HubSpot offices and remotely.</strong></p><p><strong>We’re building two products at HubSpot, one for our customers and one for our employees. Culture is the product we build for ourselves. We obsess over culture at HubSpot, just like we do our product. Company culture has always been in HubSpot’s DNA. In 2013, our co-founder Dharmesh Shah investigated what makes HubSpot’s culture better and codified it in the HubSpot Culture Code, a 120+ slide deck about what we value, how we work, and who we aspire to be. HubSpot’s Culture Code, which has more than 5.5M views, captures our commitment to solving for the customer, creating a diverse and inclusive organization, and celebrating HEART, an acronym that stands for the traits we admire: Humble, Empathetic, Adaptable, Remarkable, and Transparent.</strong></p><p><strong>At HubSpot, diversity, inclusion and belonging initiatives are business-critical. We aspire to build a company that reflects the diversity of our customers and empowers employees to be their best selves. Our goal with diversity and inclusion programming at HubSpot is to create a globally inclusive culture spanning diversity of gender identity, age, ethnicity, nationality, color, sexual orientation, language, perspective, socioeconomic status, thought, and more.</strong></p><p><strong>Our culture is not tied to locations, it’s rooted in our values, our amazing people, and our mission of helping millions of organizations grow better. We want to build a company where people can do their best work. Some people work best in an office, while others work best from a home office. That’s why HubSpot is betting on hybrid for the future of work and employees can choose to work @home, @office or @flex.. We believe work isn’t a place, and that access to career opportunities and growth shouldn’t be defined by your zip code.</strong></p>","<p><span style=""color:inherit"">At HubSpot, we believe that our values live in our hearts, not our hallways.

<div style=""text-align:justify"">IUIGA was born as we pondered over one question: “Why pay so much for quality?”It is no secret that traditional retailers mark up their products by 8 to 15 times what it costs to produce them. Consumers are led into believing that the price premium they are paying goes into the higher quality they are getting. But that is not always true, yet no one has really done anything about it.</div>





<div style=""text-align:justify"">We believe that consumers have the right to know how much quality truly costs. IUIGA's mission is to challenge the status quo in the traditional retail business - by scouring the globe to work directly with the best in class designer brand manufacturers, cutting out traditional brand premiums and passing on these cost savings to our consumers.We welcome talented individuals who are passionate about what they do.</div>
