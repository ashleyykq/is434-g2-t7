These are full-time, renewable lecturer positions that include opportunities for research funding and for promotion to Associate Professor with Open Contract on the NUS Educator Track, as described below.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The primary responsibility is to offer one of our mandatory courses, to which you will be expected to bring your own academic and intellectual expertise. The courses and corresponding positions are:</span></span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span>Reasoning with Data (RWD)</span></span></p><p><span><span>This course introduces first year NUSC students to the thoughtful use of data to answer questions and assess claims, using various quantitative tools such as statistics. Candidates must hold a PhD in any disciplinary background where quantitative reasoning is essential; in particular, in subjects related to statistics, mathematics, applied sciences, natural sciences, quantitative social sciences, and computing. Prior experience in teaching undergraduates in small classes with students from mixed disciplines will be an advantage. We are especially interested in active scholars who have been involved in interdisciplinary teaching. The primary responsibility will be to co-design and teach Reasoning with Data. Prior knowledge of R is preferable but not essential. Successful candidates are expected to offer 3 sections of Reasoning with Data in the academic year, an elective of their own design, and take on a small supervision load.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Computational Problem Solving (CPS)</span></span></p><p><span><span>This course enables NUSC students to learn how computational methods can be used to formulate, solve, and analyse problems that relate to their everyday lives. Candidates must hold a PhD in a computer science, statistics, mathematics, or related fields. Familiarity with algorithms and algorithmic thinking is a must. Prior experience in teaching undergraduates in small classes with students from mixed disciplines will be an advantage. We are especially interested in active scholars who have been involved in interdisciplinary teaching and have experience using computational methods to solve problems in academia or industry. The primary responsibility will be to design and teach Computational Problem Solving. Successful candidates are expected to offer 3 sections of Computational Problem Solving in the academic year, an elective of their own design, and take on small supervision load of independent study modules.</span></span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span>Science and Society (SNS)</span></span></p><p><span><span>This team-taught module explores the intersection and interplay of science and society, how scientific knowledge and technological development influence and shape institutions, societies, and environments. We encourage scientists with an interest in how science interacts with society, and social scientists with research and teaching interests in the natural sciences, to apply. We are particularly interested in hiring candidates with research and teaching interests from the fields of STEM, social sciences, humanities (e.g., sociology, anthropology, and history), or from interdisciplinary fields (e.g., environmental studies, public health, development studies). Familiarity with the Science and Technology Studies (STS) literature is beneficial. The primary responsibility will be to contribute to designing and teaching the Science and Society module which explores the intersections between science and society in a small class setting. Successful candidates should be able to demonstrate the ability to teach outside of their primary discipline, to lead discussion-based seminars, and to identify, design, and implement case studies that demonstrate the connection between science and society. Successful candidates are expected to offer 3 sections of Science and Society in the academic year, an elective of their own design, and take on small supervision load of independent study modules.</span></span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span>Apart from offering sections for one of the above courses, a secondary responsibility is to contribute to other parts of NUSC education and more broadly to new developments in interdisciplinary honours education in NUS. This role could include designing and teaching more specialised, knowledge-based elective classes that are interdisciplinary in nature and draw on your own interests and expertise. Another option is for you to offer original ideas about what other kinds of contributions you can bring to interdisciplinary education in NUS in small class settings. Generally, all NUSC classes maintain small faculty-to-student ratios. No matter what secondary role you see yourself performing, you should have a commitment to innovation in undergraduate and honours education, be devoted to your own research and teaching excellence, and have the willingness and ability to engage students from diverse disciplinary backgrounds.</span></span></p></div></div><div><div>Qualifications</div><div><p><span><span>Candidates must hold a PhD by August 2022. While we are keen to hire individuals able to start by that time, we will also consider individuals able to start by January 2023. Remuneration and benefits are highly competitive on the global research university level. Benefits include relocation assistance and a housing subsidy for the first nine years. Appointments begin at the level of Lecturer on the Educator Track, or possibly the level of Senior Lecturer if previous experience warrants it. Although the NUS Educator Track is not a tenurable line, it offers a pathway to promotion to Associate Professorship on an open contract (and beyond), as well as opportunities for research funding, including overseas research and conference travel. The contract is for three years in the first instance and is renewable subject to good performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Interested applicants should prepare and submit the following documents when they apply:</span></span></p><ul><li><span><span>A cover letter, clearly specifying which position they are applying for.</span></span></li><li><span><span>CV: An abridged CV (5-page maximum), including details on education, employment history, past experience of teaching and supervision, research activities (including publications) and achievements, honours and awards, and service accomplishments.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Qualifications: Include scanned copies of academic degrees.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Teaching Portfolio:</span></span><ul><li><span><span>A Teaching Statement that commences with a preface (maximum 300 words) that makes the case for appointment. This should be a highly distilled summary of key contributions to student learning and, if applicable, educational leadership, guided by your teaching philosophy. The rest of the Statement, of not more than 2,000 words, should outline your teaching philosophy and your educational contribution across multiple dimensions and roles. Please include evidence on how you have impact students' learning experience and outcomes as well as how you have influenced peers and the community.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Teaching evaluations and peer review reports, if available. Other evidence of teaching excellence and/or other contributions to education, e.g., curriculum development, pedagogical innovation etc., should also be provided.</span></span></li></ul></li></ul></div></div><div><div><ul><li><span><span>A proposal, of not more than 500 words, describing a prospective syllabus for the target course.</span></span></li><li><span><span>A statement, of not more than 500 words, highlighting how you plan to contribute to pedagogical innovation and/or advance interdisciplinary honours education at NUSC.</span></span></li><li><span><span>FOUR referees' letters (one of whom must be the applicant's PhD supervisor).

<div style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC)</strong> was incorporated on 3 March 1989 and commenced operation in October 1990. It is the designated national centre for ophthalmology within Singapore’s public sector healthcare network, with a faculty of close to 80 ophthalmologists and more than 800 staff. SNEC spearheads and coordinates the provision of specialised ophthalmological services with emphasis on quality education and research. </div>



<div style=""text-align:justify"">SNEC manages more than 330,000 patient visits and performs over 35,000 surgeries and laser procedures annually.  The centre offers a full spectrum of subspecialties addressing every part of the eye – Cataract, Corneal &amp; External Eye Disease, General Cataract &amp; Comprehensive Ophthalmology, Glaucoma, Neuro-ophthalmology, Ocular Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Oculoplastic, Paediatric Ophthalmology and Adult Strabismus, Refractive Surgery, Surgical and Medical Retina.</div>





<div style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI) </strong>was established in 1997 as Singapore’s national research institute for ophthalmic and vision research. It is the research arm of SNEC, and affiliated to the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Duke-NUS Medical School, as part of the SingHealth-Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre.</div>



<div style=""text-align:justify"">Over the years, SERI has invested considerable resources into its research infrastructure and in the training of the next generation of clinician-scientists, clinician-researchers and scientists. In two decades, SERI has grown from a founding team of 5 to over 200 researchers, doctors and support staff, and is the largest eye research institute in the Asia-Pacific region.</div>



<div style=""text-align:justify"">A global leader in eye research, SERI ranks ahead of its counterparts in the US, UK and Japan in terms of ophthalmology publications per capita. Tapping on its close affiliation to SNEC, SERI is in the unique position to translate basic research into cutting edge clinical care by enabling the development of new treatments for a variety of eye diseases.</div>
</div>","<p>Established in 1997, SERI is Singapore’s national research institute for ophthalmic and vision research. SERI’s mission is to conduct high-impact eye research that prevents blindness, low vision and major eye diseases common to Singaporeans and Asians. Over the last decade, SERI has conducted landmark research projects that have led to tangible outcomes, patient benefits, and success stories. It has paved the way for significant improvements in how eye diseases are treated and prevented, not just for Singaporeans or Asians, but on a global scale.</p><p>SERI has grown from a founding team of five in 1997 to a faculty of more than 238 staff, encompassing clinician scientists, scientists, research fellows, PhD students and support staff. This makes SERI one of the largest research institutes in Singapore, as well as the largest eye research institute in the Asia Pacific region. SERI has also over 230 adjunct faculties from various eye departments, biomedical institutes and tertiary centres in Singapore. SERI has published an impressive array of 4,504 scientific papers, and has secured external peer-reviewed competitive grants worth more than $360 million. As of August 2021, SERI’s faculty has been awarded with more than 755 national and international prizes and filed 145 patents.</p><p><strong>Are you searching for an opportunity to apply/develop your skills and expertise?

For more information about our Laboratory, please visit: <a href=""https://www.ophthalmic.engineering/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"" referrerpolicy=""origin"">https://www.ophthalmic.engineering</a></p><p>Glaucoma is a major blinding disorder and is defined by cell damage at the back of the eye within a structure called the optic nerve head (ONH). When cells are damaged, visual information cannot reach the brain, and the patient is declared legally blind from glaucoma. At the beginning of the last century, we thought that glaucoma would only occur when the pressure within the eye was elevated. Mechanically it makes sense: a high pressure would stretch tissues and cells within the eye which could result in damage. While this has already been accepted as a common mechanism for glaucoma, some patients with normal pressure within their eyes still develop glaucoma. To understand this, our group, and others, have identified other loads acting on the ONH, such as the pressure within the skull that can be transmitted back to the eye, and the pulling force of the optic nerve - the cable linking the eye to the brain - that can increase during eye movements. It may be that some patients develop glaucoma because those 2 loads are abnormal independently of eye pressure. Our research is exciting because we will propose engineering and artificial intelligence tools to fully assess and understand the robustness of the ONH in a given patient.</p><p>For the role of a Research Fellow, you will be working in the Bioengineering &amp; Devices Research Group at SERI, with the following (but not limited to) responsibilities,</p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Our goal is to establish whether ONH robustness can help us predict who is at risk of developing future glaucoma damage, and if proven, we will be able to provide earlier treatment in the eyes that are deemed mechanically unstable.</li><li>For this project, the successful candidate will use, improve and develop image processing algorithms (e.g. digital volume correlation) to assess the biomechanics of the ONH using 3D medical imaging (optical coherence tomography).</li><li>The candidate will also develop deep learning algorithms (e.g. autoencoders, GNNs) to assess the structural and biomechanical signature of glaucoma sub-types, and how such signatures can help us predict the patients that are at most risks of fast vision loss.</li></ul><p>The duties and responsibilities outlined are not intended to be an exhaustive list but provide guidance on the main aspects of the job role.</p><p><strong>Job Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>Candidates with PhD in Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, or other related disciplines are encouraged to apply</li><li>Excellent programming skills (in Python) and strong knowledge of deep learning techniques is required.</li><li>Good foundation in continuum mechanics</li><li>Knowledge of the Finite Element Method, Virtual Fields Method, and optical coherence tomography is considered a plus</li><li>No background in ophthalmology is required</li></ul><p>Note: Package offered will commensurate with qualifications and experience.</p>",[],Junior Executive,,1 year,Doctorate (PhD),,Contract,,"['Regular hours, Mondays - Fridays', 'Business (e.g. Shirts)']",https://myjobstreet.jobstreet.com.sg/application/online-apply.php?job_id=9325961&advertisement_id=9324332&s=20&AdvertisementSource=1,701718,Outram,sg
