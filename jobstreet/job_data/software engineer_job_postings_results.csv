<div>Carro is an automotive marketplace that offers a full-stack service for all aspects of car ownership. By offering a trustworthy and transparent experience, Carro challenges the traditional way of buying and selling cars through a proprietary pricing algorithm.</div>

<div>Besides selling cars, Carro provides services that offer a car owner everything they need throughout their car ownership journey. In 2019, Carro introduced the First Car Subscription Service in Singapore. The new service aims to provide Singaporeans with a commitment-free car ownership experience, unlike the traditional.</div>

<div>Carro’s technology-driven services leverage innovation and technology to provide consumers with a seamless experience. These include an in-house financing solution through its sister company Genie Financial Services and a suite of after-sales services such as an in-house car care workshop and Singapore’s first on-demand roadside recovery platform. In 2020, Carro redefined the car buying experience with Singapore’s first contactless service, providing consumers with added assurance through a 3-day return policy and 30-day wear and tear guarantee. </div>

<div><strong>Best Funded Automotive Marketplace</strong></div>

<div>Founded in 2015, Carro is Southeast Asia’s largest automotive marketplace, with the company having expanded to Thailand and Indonesia in 2017. Carro’s expansion coincides with exponential year-on-year growth, recording over US$100 million worth of transactions in 2016, with figures doubling to over US$250 million in 2017 and again doubling to US$500 million in 2018. In 2020, the total transactions stand at over US$1 billion.</div>

<div>In August 2019, Carro closed their Series B funding round at US$90 million. The round was supported by notable names such as SoftBank Ventures Asia, EDBI Pte Ltd, Insignia Ventures Partners, B Capital Group and many more. Overall, Carro has raised US$105 million since its inception. The funding has allowed the company to expand its presence across Southeast Asia and improve existing services in its automotive ecosystem.</div>

In Germany, we predominantly supply hospitals, GPs’ surgeries, emergency services and corporations. Since 2007, Fleischhacker has also been distributing its MediConnect® software – a comprehensive solution for the management of clinical processes in hospitals and in GPs’ surgeries.</p><p><strong>What Makes Us Different</strong></p><p>It comes down to well-grounded know-how and comprehensive expertise within the hospital sector. Having extensive experience in equipping clinics and surgeries coupled with a high capability to streamline structures, we are able to optimize your processes. It is this optimization that encapsulates the quality of consulting and advice we offer. This extends from our belief that the key to securing substantial progress and quality in health care is achieved through the reorganization of clinical routines in hospitals through cutting edge processes, intelligent connections and innovative standardization.</p><p>Yet Fleischhacker is more than just a service provider. We are a partner you can trust. Our expertise extends to you by maximizing the quality of services you provide. For example, the modular planning of hospitals in developing countries, with its associated infrastructural challenges and medical problems, requires a high degree of structuring complex processes. We have the means to contribute substantially to this kind of project planning with our specialized experience, intuition and sensitivity.</p>","<p><strong>Job Responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Participate in requirements analysis;</li><li>Collaborate with development teams to produce Web-based user interface;</li><li>Write clean, scalable codes using .NET programming languages;</li><li>Test and deploy applications and systems.</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>Degree in Computer Science/Information Technology or related discipline;</li><li>Familiar with the ASP.NET framework, SQL Server and design/architectural patterns;</li><li>Knowledge of at least one of the .NET languages (e.g. C#, Visual Basic .NET) and HTML5/CSS3;</li><li>Understanding of Agile methodologies;</li><li>Knowledge of the healthcare industry will be an added advantage;</li><li>Passionate about programming, pro-active in finding and suggesting a solution;</li><li>Results-oriented and good team player.</li></ul><p>We regret to inform that only shortlisted candidates will be notified.</p>","['Professional and personal development', 'Collaborative work culture', 'Work-life harmony']",Junior Executive,,4 years,"Diploma, Advanced/Higher/Graduate Diploma, Bachelor's Degree, Post Graduate Diploma, Professional Degree, Master's Degree",,Full-Time,,"['Dental', 'Medical', 'Regular hours, Mondays - Fridays', 'Smart Casual']",https://myjobstreet.jobstreet.com.sg/application/online-apply.php?job_id=9363160&advertisement_id=9361531&s=20&AdvertisementSource=1,701710,Toa Payoh,sg

By choosing not to design, manufacture or market any semiconductor products under its own name, the Company ensures that it never competes with its customers. And so, the key to TSMC’s success has always been to focus on its customers’ success. TSMC’s foundry business model has enabled the rise of the global fabless industry, and since its inception TSMC has been the world’s leading semiconductor foundry. The Company manufactured 11,617 different products using 281 distinct technologies for 510 different customers in 2020.</p><p>TSMC-made semiconductors serve a global customer base that is large and diverse and includes a wide range of applications. These products are used in a variety of end markets including mobile devices, high performance computing, automotive electronics and the Internet of Things (IoT). Such strong diversification helps to smooth fluctuations in demand, which in turn allows TSMC to maintain higher levels of capacity utilization and profitability, and generate healthy returns for future investment.</p><p>The annual capacity of the manufacturing facilities managed by TSMC and its subsidiaries exceeded 12 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2020. These facilities include four 12-inch wafer GIGAFAB® fabs, four 8-inch wafer fabs, and one 6-inch wafer fab – all in Taiwan – as well as one 12-inch wafer fab at a wholly owned subsidiary, TSMC Nanjing Company Limited, and two 8-inch wafer fabs at wholly owned subsidiaries, WaferTech in the United States and TSMC China Company Limited.</p><p>In May 2020, TSMC announced its intention to build and operate an advanced semiconductor fab in the United States, in order to better support customers and partners there as well as to attract global talents. This facility, to be built in Arizona, will utilize TSMC’s 5-nanometer technology for semiconductor wafer fabrication and will have a capacity of 20,000 semiconductor wafers per month. Construction is planned to start in 2021 with production targeted for 2024.</p><p>TSMC provides customer support, account management and engineering services through offices in North America, Europe, Japan, China, and South Korea.
