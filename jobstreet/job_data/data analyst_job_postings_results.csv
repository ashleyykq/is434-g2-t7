Engineered water systems (such as drinking water distribution and HVAC systems) contain consortia of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances referred to as biofilms. Biofilms have been shown to harbor a broad variety of microorganisms associated with corrosion of the pipe material, lead to the breakdown of residual disinfectants like monochloramine, and are known to support the growth of opportunistic waterborne pathogens. In previous projects, an array of sensor nodes was established wirelessly in the drinking water distribution networks (DWDS) of two campuses in Singapore, measuring water quality and leak-detection associated parameters in real-time, and providing easy access to the network. More recently, a simulated Intermittent Water Distribution system and laboratory scale HVAC / chiller unit circles have been established and will be the foundation of in-depth research into the impact of hydraulic and physicochemical conditions on the formation of potentially hazardous biofilms and their microbial composition.</div><div style=""text-align:justify"">We are looking for a self-driven, committed, and inquisitive Data Analyst to join our drinking water distribution team at SCELSE.

<div>Carro is an automotive marketplace that offers a full-stack service for all aspects of car ownership. By offering a trustworthy and transparent experience, Carro challenges the traditional way of buying and selling cars through a proprietary pricing algorithm.</div>

<div>Besides selling cars, Carro provides services that offer a car owner everything they need throughout their car ownership journey. In 2019, Carro introduced the First Car Subscription Service in Singapore. The new service aims to provide Singaporeans with a commitment-free car ownership experience, unlike the traditional.</div>

<div>Carro’s technology-driven services leverage innovation and technology to provide consumers with a seamless experience. These include an in-house financing solution through its sister company Genie Financial Services and a suite of after-sales services such as an in-house car care workshop and Singapore’s first on-demand roadside recovery platform. In 2020, Carro redefined the car buying experience with Singapore’s first contactless service, providing consumers with added assurance through a 3-day return policy and 30-day wear and tear guarantee. </div>

<div><strong>Best Funded Automotive Marketplace</strong></div>

<div>Founded in 2015, Carro is Southeast Asia’s largest automotive marketplace, with the company having expanded to Thailand and Indonesia in 2017.

In 2020, the total transactions stand at over US$1 billion.</div>

<div>In August 2019, Carro closed their Series B funding round at US$90 million.
