<div>Carro is an automotive marketplace that offers a full-stack service for all aspects of car ownership. By offering a trustworthy and transparent experience, Carro challenges the traditional way of buying and selling cars through a proprietary pricing algorithm.</div>

<div>Besides selling cars, Carro provides services that offer a car owner everything they need throughout their car ownership journey. In 2019, Carro introduced the First Car Subscription Service in Singapore. The new service aims to provide Singaporeans with a commitment-free car ownership experience, unlike the traditional.</div>

These include an in-house financing solution through its sister company Genie Financial Services and a suite of after-sales services such as an in-house car care workshop and Singapore’s first on-demand roadside recovery platform. In 2020, Carro redefined the car buying experience with Singapore’s first contactless service, providing consumers with added assurance through a 3-day return policy and 30-day wear and tear guarantee. </div>

<div><strong>Best Funded Automotive Marketplace</strong></div>

<div>Founded in 2015, Carro is Southeast Asia’s largest automotive marketplace, with the company having expanded to Thailand and Indonesia in 2017.

In 2020, the total transactions stand at over US$1 billion.</div>
