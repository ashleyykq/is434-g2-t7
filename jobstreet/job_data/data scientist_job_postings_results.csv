<div><strong>About Fraser and Neave, Limited</strong></div>



<div>
<div>
<div>Fraser and Neave, Limited (""F&amp;N"" or the ""Group"") had its origins, more than a century ago, in the spirited decisions of two enterprising young men, John Fraser and David Neave, who diversified from their printing business to pioneer the aerated water business in Southeast Asia in 1883. From a soft drinks base, F&amp;N ventured into the businesses of beer in 1931, dairies in 1959, property development and management in 1990 and publishing &amp; printing in 2000. In 2012, the Group divested a substantial part of its beer business. In 2013, as F&amp;N celebrated its 130th year of operation, it also welcomed its new majority shareholder, the TCC Group, which is engaged in food and beverage, real estate, industrial trading and consumer products, insurance and agriculture. In January 2014, through a distribution in specie and re-listing of Frasers Property Limited by way of introduction on the Singapore stock exchange, the Group demerged its Properties business.</div>

<div><br />
Today, F&amp;N is a leading Asia Pacific Consumer Group with expertise and prominent standing in the Food &amp; Beverage and Publishing &amp; Printing industries. Leveraging its strengths in marketing and distribution, research and development, brands and financial management, as well as years of acquisition experience, the Group provides key resources and sets strategic directions for its subsidiary companies across both industries.<br />
<br />
Listed on the Singapore stock exchange, F&amp;N ranks as one of the most established and successful companies in the region with an impressive array of renowned brands that enjoy strong market leadership. F&amp;N is present in 11 countries spanning Asia Pacific, Europe and the USA, and employs over 7,700 people worldwide.</div>

<div style=""text-align:justify"">SNEC manages more than 330,000 patient visits and performs over 35,000 surgeries and laser procedures annually.  The centre offers a full spectrum of subspecialties addressing every part of the eye – Cataract, Corneal &amp; External Eye Disease, General Cataract &amp; Comprehensive Ophthalmology, Glaucoma, Neuro-ophthalmology, Ocular Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Oculoplastic, Paediatric Ophthalmology and Adult Strabismus, Refractive Surgery, Surgical and Medical Retina.</div>





<div style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI) </strong>was established in 1997 as Singapore’s national research institute for ophthalmic and vision research. It is the research arm of SNEC, and affiliated to the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Duke-NUS Medical School, as part of the SingHealth-Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre.</div>



<div style=""text-align:justify"">Over the years, SERI has invested considerable resources into its research infrastructure and in the training of the next generation of clinician-scientists, clinician-researchers and scientists.

</div>","<p>Established in 1997, SERI is Singapore’s national research institute for ophthalmic and vision research. SERI’s mission is to conduct high-impact eye research that prevents blindness, low vision and major eye diseases common to Singaporeans and Asians. Over the last decade, SERI has conducted landmark research projects that have led to tangible outcomes, patient benefits, and success stories. It has paved the way for significant improvements in how eye diseases are treated and prevented, not just for Singaporeans or Asians, but on a global scale.</p><p>SERI has grown from a founding team of five in 1997 to a faculty of more than 238 staff, encompassing clinician scientists, scientists, research fellows, PhD students and support staff.

SERI has also over 230 adjunct faculties from various eye departments, biomedical institutes and tertiary centres in Singapore. SERI has published an impressive array of 4,504 scientific papers, and has secured external peer-reviewed competitive grants worth more than $360 million.

Secondly, ambiguously mapped peptides are often discarded prior to protein mapping but also carry useful information regarding batch-effect loading, this project examines the cost, in terms of being able to estimate batch effect, of discarding this information source.

<div>
<div>
<div>National Gallery Singapore is a leading visual arts institution overseeing the largest public collection of modern art in Singapore and Southeast Asia. Situated at the birthplace of modern Singapore, in the heart of the Civic District, the Gallery is housed in two national monuments – City Hall and former Supreme Court – that have been beautifully restored and transformed into this exciting 64,000 square metres venue. Reflecting Singapore’s unique heritage and geographical location, the Gallery aims to be a progressive museum that creates dialogues between the art of Singapore, Southeast Asia and the world to foster and inspire a creative and inclusive society. This is reflected in our collaborative research, education initiatives, long-term and special exhibitions, and innovative programming. The Gallery also works with international museums such as National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo (MOMAT), National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea (MMCA), Centre Pompidou, Musée d'Orsay and Tate Britain to jointly present Southeast Asian art in the global context, positioning Singapore as a key node in the global visual arts scene.</div>



<div>In 2018, the Gallery was the only museum in Southeast Asia that received a ranking in The Art Newspaper’s annual global survey of attendance at museums and took the 38th place. It is also the first museum in Asia to receive the Children in Museums Award by the European Museum Academy and Hands On! International Association of Children in Museums. It also won the awards for “Best Theme Attraction” at TTG Travel Awards 2017, “Best Attraction Experience”, “Breakthrough Contribution to Tourism” and “Best Customer Service (Attractions)” at the prestigious Singapore Tourism Awards in 2016 for its role in adding to the vibrancy of Singapore’s tourism landscape.
