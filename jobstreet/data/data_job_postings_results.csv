<div style=""text-align:justify"">
<div>Carro is an automotive marketplace that offers a full-stack service for all aspects of car ownership. By offering a trustworthy and transparent experience, Carro challenges the traditional way of buying and selling cars through a proprietary pricing algorithm.</div>

<div>Besides selling cars, Carro provides services that offer a car owner everything they need throughout their car ownership journey. In 2019, Carro introduced the First Car Subscription Service in Singapore. The new service aims to provide Singaporeans with a commitment-free car ownership experience, unlike the traditional.</div>

<div>Carro’s technology-driven services leverage innovation and technology to provide consumers with a seamless experience. These include an in-house financing solution through its sister company Genie Financial Services and a suite of after-sales services such as an in-house car care workshop and Singapore’s first on-demand roadside recovery platform. In 2020, Carro redefined the car buying experience with Singapore’s first contactless service, providing consumers with added assurance through a 3-day return policy and 30-day wear and tear guarantee. </div>

<div><strong>Best Funded Automotive Marketplace</strong></div>

<div>Founded in 2015, Carro is Southeast Asia’s largest automotive marketplace, with the company having expanded to Thailand and Indonesia in 2017. Carro’s expansion coincides with exponential year-on-year growth, recording over US$100 million worth of transactions in 2016, with figures doubling to over US$250 million in 2017 and again doubling to US$500 million in 2018. In 2020, the total transactions stand at over US$1 billion.</div>

<div>In August 2019, Carro closed their Series B funding round at US$90 million. The round was supported by notable names such as SoftBank Ventures Asia, EDBI Pte Ltd, Insignia Ventures Partners, B Capital Group and many more. Overall, Carro has raised US$105 million since its inception. The funding has allowed the company to expand its presence across Southeast Asia and improve existing services in its automotive ecosystem.</div>

<div>Carro is an automotive marketplace that offers a full-stack service for all aspects of car ownership. By offering a trustworthy and transparent experience, Carro challenges the traditional way of buying and selling cars through a proprietary pricing algorithm.</div>

<div>Besides selling cars, Carro provides services that offer a car owner everything they need throughout their car ownership journey. In 2019, Carro introduced the First Car Subscription Service in Singapore. The new service aims to provide Singaporeans with a commitment-free car ownership experience, unlike the traditional.</div>

<div>Carro’s technology-driven services leverage innovation and technology to provide consumers with a seamless experience. These include an in-house financing solution through its sister company Genie Financial Services and a suite of after-sales services such as an in-house car care workshop and Singapore’s first on-demand roadside recovery platform. In 2020, Carro redefined the car buying experience with Singapore’s first contactless service, providing consumers with added assurance through a 3-day return policy and 30-day wear and tear guarantee. </div>

<div><strong>Best Funded Automotive Marketplace</strong></div>

<div>Founded in 2015, Carro is Southeast Asia’s largest automotive marketplace, with the company having expanded to Thailand and Indonesia in 2017. Carro’s expansion coincides with exponential year-on-year growth, recording over US$100 million worth of transactions in 2016, with figures doubling to over US$250 million in 2017 and again doubling to US$500 million in 2018. In 2020, the total transactions stand at over US$1 billion.</div>

<div>In August 2019, Carro closed their Series B funding round at US$90 million. The round was supported by notable names such as SoftBank Ventures Asia, EDBI Pte Ltd, Insignia Ventures Partners, B Capital Group and many more. Overall, Carro has raised US$105 million since its inception. The funding has allowed the company to expand its presence across Southeast Asia and improve existing services in its automotive ecosystem.</div>

<div><strong>About Fraser and Neave, Limited</strong></div>



<div>
<div>
<div>Fraser and Neave, Limited (""F&amp;N"" or the ""Group"") had its origins, more than a century ago, in the spirited decisions of two enterprising young men, John Fraser and David Neave, who diversified from their printing business to pioneer the aerated water business in Southeast Asia in 1883. From a soft drinks base, F&amp;N ventured into the businesses of beer in 1931, dairies in 1959, property development and management in 1990 and publishing &amp; printing in 2000. In 2012, the Group divested a substantial part of its beer business. In 2013, as F&amp;N celebrated its 130th year of operation, it also welcomed its new majority shareholder, the TCC Group, which is engaged in food and beverage, real estate, industrial trading and consumer products, insurance and agriculture. In January 2014, through a distribution in specie and re-listing of Frasers Property Limited by way of introduction on the Singapore stock exchange, the Group demerged its Properties business.</div>

<div><br />
Today, F&amp;N is a leading Asia Pacific Consumer Group with expertise and prominent standing in the Food &amp; Beverage and Publishing &amp; Printing industries. Leveraging its strengths in marketing and distribution, research and development, brands and financial management, as well as years of acquisition experience, the Group provides key resources and sets strategic directions for its subsidiary companies across both industries.<br />
<br />
Listed on the Singapore stock exchange, F&amp;N ranks as one of the most established and successful companies in the region with an impressive array of renowned brands that enjoy strong market leadership. F&amp;N is present in 11 countries spanning Asia Pacific, Europe and the USA, and employs over 7,700 people worldwide.</div>

Engineered water systems (such as drinking water distribution and HVAC systems) contain consortia of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances referred to as biofilms. Biofilms have been shown to harbor a broad variety of microorganisms associated with corrosion of the pipe material, lead to the breakdown of residual disinfectants like monochloramine, and are known to support the growth of opportunistic waterborne pathogens. In previous projects, an array of sensor nodes was established wirelessly in the drinking water distribution networks (DWDS) of two campuses in Singapore, measuring water quality and leak-detection associated parameters in real-time, and providing easy access to the network.

		The setting up of a consumer credit bureau in Singapore is a significant addition to enhance the Republic´s risk management capability. Since 2002, the Banking Act has allowed CBS members to disclose and obtain credit-related information to mitigate consumer credit risk through information pooling from CBS. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) provides the regulatory guidance and support to CBS to bolster the integrity and transparency of Singapore´s financial sector.</div>

		<br />
		To do this, CBS aggregates credit-related information amongst participating members and presents a more complete risk profile of a customer to credit providers. This helps credit providers to determine the likelihood of the customer repaying, thus enhancing their risk assessment capabilities. Our goal is to help credit providers make better lending decisions quickly and more objectively.</div>

Secondly, ambiguously mapped peptides are often discarded prior to protein mapping but also carry useful information regarding batch-effect loading, this project examines the cost, in terms of being able to estimate batch effect, of discarding this information source.

Its programmes assist students and individuals with education and training, helping to uplift the Malay/Muslim community’s educational performance and develop its resilience and adaptability. MENDAKI also charts its strategic directions based on three pillars — School Ready, Perform in School and Future Ready.</div>
		
		<div>
			The School Ready pillar focuses on laying the foundation for pre-schoolers to ensure school readiness. At the other end of the spectrum, the Future Ready programmes generate awareness for lifelong learning and facilitate the cultivation of competencies and acquisition of skills for the competitive talent market of the future economy. Programmes under the Perform in School pillar, which have formed the bedrock of MENDAKI’s programmes since its formation, focus on providing holistic support towards learning throughout the school years.</div>
		
		<div>
			MENDAKI continues to work extensively with partners that share and support its vision and mission. They consist of government agencies, schools, mosques, Malay/Muslim organisations, employers, community centres and MAECs, family and student service centres and many more.</div>
		
		<div>
			MENDAKI’s logo captures the essence of its efforts to uplift the underprivileged and nurturing a learning community. At its core is the stylistic rendition of the Quranic term IQRA which means “Read!”. It was the first word revealed by Allah swt to Prophet Muhammad saw and advocates the pursuit of knowledge.</div>
